She said Pesh’s craving for a lavish lifestyle was what landed her in trouble.“Wuuuii I do feel pain for Pesh. She was my campo student mate at MKU back in 2014 she was doing a degree in project management. Peers pushed her to bad company. She had the figure naturally. So akaanza socialiting. Her first trip was Dubai. Kwa zile harakati she met a Naija who showed her good life here and money. Little did she know the Nigerian is a drug dealer,” Lydiah Wairimu narrated in part in a Facebook post.She added that;“So the day Pesh was leaving Ghana the guy hired a taxi to take her to the airport kumbe zile manguo amepack tonnes en tonnes of drugs ndio hakutala kumpeleka airport.”Lydiah stated that the Nigerian drug dealer who was using Pesh to traffic drugs had multiple identities, adding that Ghanaian authorities couldn’t trace the Nigerian with the names Pesh gave them.“Poor girl she didn’t know she was being used by the naija men to transport drugs. So innocently she arrived@ Ghana airport bag kaenda checking kawaida. ikapatikana drugs worth 30m ksh.

In issuing the relief countermanding that was made by the High Court and by referring the matter to the arbitrator, and making a full and final determination on matters still pending before the High Court, the Court of Appeal fell into further error,"" Justice Mwilu led bench stated.The decision comes after Bia Tosha appealed a decision by the Court of Appeal ruling dated July 10, 2020, that Kenya Breweries Limited had been allowed to repossess some routes from it and reallocate them to other distributors, who could not access the market areas.The Appeal Court also referred Kenya Breweries Limited and Bia Tosha to arbitration as per their distribution agreement while dispensing an application for contempt and arrest of EABL executives.Further, the Supreme Court has directed the High Court to consider the consequences of any disobedience of the orders issued by Justice Onguto. It found there was contempt on the part of EABL and UDV (Kenya) Limited for interfering with some routes.""Having overturned the Court of Appeal judgment and having established that there was contempt of court, the same should not go unpunished. We direct the High Court to, based on our finding on contempt, issue suitable punishment for contempt of court on a priority basis as it deals with the petition pending before it on its merits,"" said the Supreme court.""Having found that there was contempt of court, the High Court should also proceed to assess the suitable punishment arising out of the contempt application dated August 23, 2016, by Boa Tosha pending before it."" the Apex court judges ruledThe 22 routes that Bia Tosha claimed exclusive control and which had been repossessed and given to other companies are Namanga, Bissil, Kajiado, Kitengela, Athi River, Industrial Area, South B, and Nairobi West.Others are Kenyatta, Langata, Rongai, Kiserian, Magadi, Upperhill, Ngong Road, Hurlingham, Kawangware, Satellite, Dagoretti, UDV A, UDV B, and UDV C.The genesis of the matter started in 1997 when the partnership between Bia Tosha and EABL was entered when the former was appointed as a distributor for the later's products within Gachie, Mwimuto, Kanunga, Kiambaa, Banana, Karura, Gathanga, Ndenderu, Ndumberi, Tinganga, Riabai, Kanguya, Wangige, and Ridgeways.Subsequently, in the year 2000, through a letter dated July 20, 2000, Bia Tosha was offered new distribution areas namely Baba Dogo, Kariobangi North, Dandora I, and Dandora II on the condition that it would pay a non-refundable goodwill of Sh6,630,000 to the Kenya Breweries.In the year 2006, Bia Tosha’s territory grew and included areas of Namanga, Bissil, Kajiado, Kitengela, Athi River, Industrial Area, South B, Nairobi West, Kenyatta, Langata, Rongai, Kiserian, Magadi, Upperhill, Ngong Road, Hurlingham, Kawangware, Satellite, Dagoretti, UDV A, UDV B, and UDV C.For these territories, the distributor was asked to pay goodwill amounting to Sh31,668,000 out of which it paid Sh27.3 million.Sometime thereafter, the Kenya Breweries re-possessed Baba Dogo, Dandora I and II, and Kariobangi North, from Bia Tosha to enable the brewer to serve the new areas and Bia Tosha requested to be refunded the goodwill for the territories that were repossessed.This, the Kenya Breweries declined, indicating that the amounts were non-refundable, and further claimed that it was within their discretion to appoint other distributors as the agreement was non-exclusive. This ignited the dispute after Kenya Breweries assigned other distributors in the area."

For instance, recently, governor Mutahi Kahiga came under immense pressure from lovebirds who demanded that he stops everything to first ensure there is Java and KFC in Nyeri town where couples can go for Valentine's Day dates.Anyway, how can folks in the villages where there are no roses, KFC, Java et al celebrate Valentine's Day?Below are some suggestions:Nearly all major shopping centres in Kenya have a choma zone where couples can go to on Valentine's Day and enjoy mutura, kachumbari, nyama chama, ugali among other delicacies.Go all out and spoil her with a stake of roasted goat meat then wash it down with a litre of coke and make the Valentine's Day memorable.The one advantage that remote areas have over the cities is the abundance of nature everywhere - rivers, forests and other cool stuff we see on Nat Geo.Cook your food and take her out and just chill by the river bank, on the beach or in a forest that has a nice umbrella canopy.At these picnic spots, you just surrender yourselves to nature and let romance take you to Venice or whatever destination it decides to take you.Folks in the villages can still buy their loved ones gifts as a way of celebrating Valentine's Day.Since romantic gifts are limited in the villages, you can actually be creative - like instead of sending her a glass of wine you do yoghurt, maziwa lala or even mursik whichever one she prefers. Instead of sending her red apples send her red tomatoes - one that somehow resembles the shape of the heart.Compliment that mursik and tomato with cards and walaaa... gorgeous Valentine's Day.For couples who are still dating, invite her over to your house or simbaa (boys' huts) and cook an assortment of your loved one’s favourite breakfast or dinner foods.For married couples or those in a 'come we try' kind of arrangement, try to cook her something nice - mokimo with milk tea, fish with brown ugali etc.Watching DJ Afro movies while chilling at home is another way folks upcountry could spend their Valentine's Day.Considering the fact that some homesteads don't have power or when it's there blackouts are frequent, just get a nice romantic movie on your phone and have it ready for Valentine's Day."

His friends tossed notes to him through his cell window.Other accounts hold that it was St. Valentine of Terni, a bishop, for whom the holiday was named, though it is possible the two saints were actually one person.Another says that Valentine's day may have also taken its name from a priest who was martyred about 270 CE by the emperor Claudius II Gothicus.Emperor Claudius II forbade young men to marry because he believed unmarried men made better soldiers. A priest named Valentine secretly married young couples to spare their husbands from war.Sources say the priest signed a letter “from your Valentine” to his jailer’s daughter, whom he had befriended and, by some accounts, healed from blindness. It is for this reason that his feast day is associated with love.Many stories say that Valentine was executed on February 14 about 269 AD.Cupid is a well-known symbol of Valentine’s Day. He is armed with a bow and arrows in order to pierce people’s hearts.In Roman mythology, Cupid is the son of Venus, the goddess of love and beauty.In ancient Greece, Cupid was known as Eros, the young son of Aphrodite, the goddess of love and beauty.Valentine's Day is also among the holidays that Americans are known to spend billions of dollars to commemorate."

They luckily managed to recover the body of the woman from the river.The assistant chief who confirmed the incident, said that a search is underway to retrieve the body of the remaining child adding that as a tradition, the bodies which have already been recovered are still lying at the river bank as they await the retrieval of the remaining one.Elsewhere in Gem sub-county, the bodies of a 22-year-old man and a 9-year-old girl who drowned in River Yala on Tuesday this week have been retrieved.The deceased James Ombima is said to have met his untimely death while trying to rescue Mitchelle Adhiambo who was drowning after she slipped into the river when drawing water.According to James’ elder brother Samuel Nyadue, he was attending to his vegetable farm at the river bank when he heard one of the children screaming that Mitchelle was drowning. He immediately rushed to rescue the minor, however, his efforts were rendered futile after he drowned while attempting to rescue the girl.The bodies have since been removed by the police and taken to the Yala sub-county hospital mortuary awaiting a postmortem."

Literally, a balance is needed when it comes to money and love.Today being Valentine’s Day, many couples, whether married or in a relationship look forward to getting that special treatment on this special day. And with that comes spending money to buy gifts, go for a special dinner, or even getaway, all in the name of honoring love.For those who fail to get any special treatment, it may feel like they are not loved, or they are not reciprocated in the way they would want.A 2019 study from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville reported that regardless of the happiness level within the relationship, money is a topic that couples consistently disagree on.“The relationship between love and money is complex and often considered a source of tension in relationships. While love is typically seen as an emotional connection and a feeling of affection, money is a practical and tangible aspect of life that can impact many aspects of a relationship, such as financial stability and security,” says Allan Lawrence (pictured), relationship coach and author.“Some people believe that money can’t buy love, while others hold the notion that financial stability is necessary for a healthy relationship. Ultimately, the relationship between love and money is unique to each individual and can vary greatly depending on personal values, beliefs, and life experiences,” he adds.The truth is that money is a major factor in many relationships and can have a significant impact on the stability and happiness of a partnership and differences in financial priorities, can lead to tension and conflict.Janet Benter believes that money plays a big role in marriage and if not handled well, it can easily break the relationship or marriage.“As a couple, while dating, we talked about money and how we would handle our finances after getting married. However, after marriage, that is when you have the actual practical and if you are not careful how you handle your finances, it can either break you or bring you closer,” says Janet.“We just got married recently, hence we are still adjusting. But one secret we learned along the way is that we are stronger as a team than individually, so we handle our finances together as a family. I must say so far so good,” she adds.Since Valentine’s Day is on a working day, Janet reveals her husband is at work. Janet offers: “We haven’t set a budget for it, but we will do something to celebrate our love. I hope my husband is working on something exciting.”Allan says it is important for partners to work together to establish shared financial values and find ways to support each other’s financial well-being.“How money affects a relationship depends on many factors, including individual attitudes towards money and the level of financial compatibility between partners. A relationship based solely on money can be shortlived and unsustainable. While money can provide temporary comfort and security, it cannot fulfill the emotional and psychological needs that are essential to a healthy and long-lasting relationship,” he explains.Determining financial compatibility when one partner is earning more than the other involves open and honest communication about financial goals, values, and expectations. Both partners should agree on a budget and how their earnings will be split between living expenses, savings, and personal spending.They should also discuss their long-term financial plans, including retirement, investing, or major purchases.“One word is key transparency. When both partners are honest and disclose their financial status, goals, and needs without the fear of being judged or shamed by each other, they are in a better position to walk a fruitful financial journey together. This is as opposed to when each individual in the relationship works out their finances in isolation,” Victoria Riki, a clinical psychologist."

In many countries, people celebrate this occasion by giving their lovers chocolate, flowers, and cards.However, there are a few countries that have forbidden the celebration of Valentine’s Day since it is not a part of their religion.These countries include;Saudi Arabia is a Muslim nation located in Southwest Asia and encompassing the majority of the Arabian Peninsula. As public displays of affection in Saudi Arabia are taboo, the celebration of Valentine’s Day went against the country’s ideologies.Although there are many foreign Christian workers in Saudi Arabia, the practice of their religion here is forbidden. Therefore, on February 14th, the celebration or sale of any Valentine’s Day-related items such as red roses or teddy bears were prohibited.On this day, shops might be checked by the authorities. Anything related to Valentine’s Day would be confiscated and the shop owners who violated the law might be arrested and punished.In fact, in 2014, five Saudi citizens were sentenced to 39 years in prison after being caught dancing with six women they were not married to on this occasion.Uzbekistan is well known for its long history and diverse culture with Islam as the dominant religion. The country was tolerant of Valentine’s Day celebrations for many years until 2012 when an internal decree that bans the celebration of this holiday was issued by the Ministry of Education’s Department of Enlightenment and the Promotion of Values.Instead of observing Valentine’s Day, people in Uzbekistan celebrate the birthday of their country’s hero – Babur – a Mughal Emperor. Valentine’s Day is not illegal, but it is strongly discouraged in favour of commemorating Babur.As a matter of fact, there is no law that expressly prohibits the celebration of the day in Indonesia. However, in some areas of the country such as Surabaya and Makassar where people have more radical Muslim views, intimidation tactics or small-scale bans are used while in Bando Aceh, there is an outright ban.In recent years, there have been numerous protests claiming that Valentine’s Day encourages casual pre-marital sex and the consumption of alcohol, both of which are strictly prohibited by Islamic Law. Despite this, the day is still popular and openly celebrated by youngsters in Jakarta.Iran is an Islamic country ruled by religious clerics. The government has prohibited the production of all Valentine’s Day gifts and items. The promotion of this romantic love celebration is also banned as it is cited as a spread of Western culture.It has been proposed to replace Valentine’s Day with Mehregan, an ancient festival that existed in Iran prior to the introduction of Islam. This festival honours yazata Mehr which is responsible for friendship, love, or affection.Being the world’s second-largest Muslim population, Pakistan is another country that has mixed feelings about Valentine’s Day. As the popularity of the Valentine’s Day observation among the young generation grows, several riots have occurred in this country to protest against this celebration.A private citizen petitioned the High Court in Islamabad to have the day banned. Finally, on February 7th, 2018, the Islamabad High Court banned Valentine’s Day celebrations and media coverage, claiming that it was a Western cultural import that contradicted Islamic teachings. However, not everyone in Pakistan agrees with this decision, especially university students and flower vendors who did well on Valentine’s Day.Since 2005, Islamic authorities in Malaysia have issued a fatwa (religious ruling), prohibiting the celebration of Valentine’s Day. This day is blamed for being a gateway to disaster and moral decay among young people. An anti-Valentine’s Day campaign is also held every year. People who go out and celebrate might face the risk of being arrested."

She claimed that her husband was an abusive cleric who often assaulted her over minor misunderstandings.Continuing her spiel, she revealed that her once rosy marriage turned bitter two years after their union.She pointed out that he would embarrass and abuse her before the congregation during his sermons in church, on top of that, their marriage issues would take centre stage of the entire preaching.Whenever she confronted her in-laws regarding their son's behaviour towards her, they would constantly remind her that they paid to have her and that she should persevere through the challenges that came with the union.Efforts to get them to see through their son's mistakes were futile as they asked her to continue praying for her husband to mend his ways.""I told my mother-in-law about the abuse, and she kept telling me the man was entitled to do what he likes, adding that I should keep praying for him to change,"" she told a local publication.Consequently, she drafted a scheme n how to leave her union that had turned sour. She narrated that she began saving up for her bride price money last year.However, her plans were disrupted after her abusive husband found the savings and took them with him.Determined to leave with her children, she devised a new saving plan where she was finally able to raise the money and give it back to her in-laws.“I called some of the elders who used to mediate in our struggles. They thought it was business as usual until I placed the money on the table and told them I was leaving and would not want my mother to be bothered because the debt was paid in full,” she narrated."

""We seek the court to suspend the impugned implementation of the Court of Appeal decision as there is a serious threat of monopoly and emasculation that the impugned Act (especially sections 18, 19, 20 and 71) poses to the entire pensions industry—specifically, the threat of mass transfers of employees from superior pension schemes to the NSSF,"" the County Pensioners Association states in their court papers.It is the County Pensioners Association's argument that the conservatory orders they seek will not cause any harm, damage, or prejudice to the government as allowing the state to implement the impugned NSSF Act during the pendency of their appeal would aggravate the denial/miscarriage of justice already occasioned on them.The disputed decision by Justices Hannah Okwengu, Mohamed Warsame and John Mativo has approved the NSSF Act of 2013, saying that it was subjected to public participation as required by the constitution.This was after the bench of three judges overturned a judgment delivered last September by the Employment and Labour Relations Court, which found that the NSSF Act 2013 was unconstitutional and blocked the government's bid to increase workers’ monthly deductions.Under the Act, the NSSF sought to build a bigger retirement pot and offer workers monthly stipends after their retirement as opposed to the current one-off payment.The Act increased salaried employees’ monthly deductions from Ksh200 to Ksh600 for the lowest earner and from Ksh320 to Ksh1,080 for top earners. The upper limits on contributions are set to rise every year.The total pension contribution for both the worker and employee is supposed to be a maximum of Ksh4,136, 12 percent of the proposed maximum pensionable earnings of Ksh34,476.Both employees and employers were to remit six percent each.To ease the workers’ burden, the State had proposed to stagger the payment over five years, which would see top earners pay more than Sh15,000 monthly with their employers topping an equivalent amount in the fifth year.The contributions were last reviewed in 2001 when the rate was increased to Ksh200 from Ksh160.The NSSF had 348,291 registered members as of June 2021, with an investment portfolio of Ksh284.9 billion. It beat inflation last year when savings increased by 10 percent.The appellate court bench ruled that the Labour court wrongly assumed jurisdiction in a matter that should have been handled by the High Court.The case was first filed by the Kenya Tea Growers Association and Agricultural Employers’ Association who moved to the Labour court to stop the proposed increase, arguing that the law supporting the increment was unconstitutional.Justices Mathews Nduma, Hellen Wasilwa and Monica Mbaru in a ruling delivered last year quashed the NSSF Act of 2013."

World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that almost half of all adults will have experienced at least one headache within the last year.There are over 100 types and some will go away with simple over-the-counter drugs while others are an indication of a serious underlying condition. Muthoki Kithanze explores some of them1. Migraine
This headache is usually intense and occurs on one side of the head. When experiencing a migraine you may become more sensitive to light, sound, and smell. Migraines tend to recur and each attack can last a few hours. Stress, not sleeping well, dehydration, hormonal changes, bright lights, and loud noise may trigger them. Some painkillers will relieve your symptoms, but if you experience chronic migraines frequently you might want to visit your general practitioner.2. Tension headache
These are the most common types of headaches and are characterised by pressure around the forehead — you may feel like a tight band has been placed around your forehead. The pain can vary between individuals, but it’s commonly felt all over the body as a dull, aching sensation. Sensitivity or soreness around your neck, forehead, or shoulder muscles may also occur. Tension headache may be caused by stress, anxiety, depression, and dehydration. Others are lack of exercise, sleep deprivation, and skipping meals. Painkillers such as ibuprofen and aspirin will silence the pain, but if you experience pain for more than 15 days do the wise thing and see a doctor.

3. Sinus headache
Sinus headaches are caused by sinus infection, which will manifest as pain around your eyes, cheeks, teeth, and jaw. If you do not have accompanying nasal symptoms such as a blocked nose or nasal discharge, you may be having a migraine instead. Drink fluids, and painkillers and take a rest and soon the headache will go away. Sinus headaches are also treated by thinning out mucus build-up that causes sinus pressure. Over-the-counter decongestants and antihistamines and prescription nasal steroid sprays may help relieve symptoms.

4. Head-injury headache
When you hit your head, you may develop a headache immediately or a bit later. Over-The-Counter drugs will address this, but if you start experiencing symptoms  such as unconsciousness, seizures, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, and vision or hearing problem, seek urgent medical attention as that may be indicative of a serious traumatic injury.

5. Cluster headache
This pain occurs suddenly and is felt around and behind one eye. It may last anywhere between 15 minutes to three hours. Smoking is a risk factor for cluster headaches. A cluster headache can be treated with acute and preventive drug treatment such as oxygen therapy, steroid injections, oral steroids (commonly prednisone), and melatonin.

6. Hangover headache
You experience this kind of headache the morning after a night of drinking. The headache is on both sides of the head and accompanied by nausea. It may be moderate to extreme depending on how much you drunk. Drinking a lot of water will ease this pain, but you may take over-the-counter medication if the pain is extreme.

7. Hypnic headache
This headache is commonly called an alarm clock because it occurs when a person is sleeping and wakes the person up. It begins in people who are in their 50s, but it can start sooner. The pain is dull on both sides of the head and usually wakes up a person several times the night.

8. Thunderclap headacheA thunderclap headache is an extremely severe headache that comes on rapidly, reaching peak intensity in under a minute. It may be benign, but it could also be a symptom of a serious condition requiring immediate medical attention. In some cases, a thunderclap headache could indicate: blood vessel tears, ruptures, or blockages, stroke, brain injury, reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS), vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels), or pituitary apoplexy (bleeding into or loss of blood from an organ)The first time you experience a thunderclap headache, seek immediate medical attention. If a doctor determines that your headache is not caused by another condition, you can discuss a treatment plan for possible future thunderclap headaches.

9. Exertional headache
This headache is a throbbing pain that occurs after you have engaged in strenuous physical exercise such as lifting a heavy load, running, or having sexual intercourse. It does not last long and will be resolved by over-the-counter medications.

10. Ice pick headachePrimary stabbing headaches, or ice pick headaches, are characterised by short, intense stabbing pains in your head lasting only a few seconds. These headaches can occur a few times per day and come on without warning. Ice pick headaches could feel like a single stab or multiple stabs in succession.Ice pick headaches usually move around to different parts of your head. If you are experiencing ice pick headaches that always occur in the same spot, it might be a symptom of an underlying condition."

https://www.k24tv.co.ke/,https://www.k24tv.co.ke/lifestyle/10-top-cybersecurity-trends-kenyans-must-beware-of-95299/,10 top cybersecurity trends Kenyans must beware of,"Wed, 15 Feb, 2023 06:17 | 4 mins read",https://i0.wp.com/www.k24tv.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/NY-State-Computer-and-Cyber-Crime-Defense-Attorney.jpg?resize=675%2C450&ssl=1,"With Africa experiencing the highest incidents of cyberattacks in the world last year, according to the Check Point Software 2022 Security Report, organisations and consumers must become more aware of the threats they face in the digital landscape1. Cyberattacks hit 1450 per weekCheck Point Research has signaled an increase in cyberattacks targeting the government, insurance, and finance sectors in South Africa and other African countries. On average, there have been more than 1,450 attacks per week in the country. This trend will likely continue over the coming months as more threats start coming from cloud and mobile platforms. Threat actors will not limit their focus to South Africa and will potentially target countries across the continent.2. Emergence of supply chain attacksThe rapid adoption of the cloud in Africa has seen increase in supply chain attacks with breaches occurring in the Okta cloud-based identity management platform. Check Point anticipates that these supply chain attacks will continue through 2023 with a significant amount of risk coming from the open-source community. Typically, suppliers relying on these open-source systems have not properly vetted them or have been lax in managing these environments, resulting in cybersecurity weak points emerging. South Africa and Kenya have become key targets around the cloud. In both countries, many companies are moving workloads to the cloud.3. Remote workforce vulnerabilitiesRemote workings forced many organizations to bank on collaboration of services and applications on several platforms. Many businesses across southern and eastern Africa still allow their staff to access corporate information on mobile devices without ensuring that enhanced security has been implemented. Top malware families like Hiddad will continue to gain access to Android-based mobile devices, repackaging legitimate apps, and distributing them to third-party stores. These apps facilitate access to key security features built-in the operating system. Even more malware alternatives will come to prominence in 2023.4. Malware disruptionsMajor malware families like Emotet (Botnet), Nanocore (RAT), and Qbot (Trojan) are expected to cause major disruptions on the continent. This will require organizations to place emphasis on security controls with a threat prevention approach across all their platforms. Doing so will strengthen their defenses against ransomware and supply chain threats. Globally, ransomware was the number one threat in 2022. Uncertainty across the various African economies around service delivery and critical infrastructure will likely see more countries face cyberattacks targeting the government. To mitigate against this risk, both public and private sectors must embrace a robust architecture that provides uncompromised security and unparalleled operational efficiency.5.Tech-driven defensesThe availability of more advanced technology means organizations can strengthen their defensive stances. For instance, Kenyan businesses have embraced the Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) and Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) approaches. These combine both the network system and security measures to enable organizations to manage both the network and network security together. It has become common for employees to connect to a company’s systems via a VPN from home or a co-working space, and use services provided in the cloud to carry out their work. With workplace and data asset locations diversifying, it has become more difficult for a company’s IT department to manage everything under a unified security policy. ZTNA and SASE bring network services and security services together, making it possible to maintain security without getting in the way of employee work.6. Increased attack velocityThe cyberthreat landscape in the coming months will put pressure on companies across Africa and the rest of the world. With the growth in adoption of artificial intelligence and machine learning, attack vectors will increase in ferocity. Organizations and consumers must embrace a comprehensive cybersecurity approach to ensure their environments are kept safe. There is simply no respite from ransomware and increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks. This puts users under increasing pressure to keep up to date with the latest trends in the threat landscape. We know that these criminals are continually evolving in how they develop and perpetrate attacks. With smaller, more agile malicious groups looking to exploit any potential weak points in company and end user defenses, people cannot afford to not take cybersecurity seriously.7. Automotive hacking is on the riseModern automobiles are equipped with automated software that provides smooth connectivity for drivers in areas such as cruise control, engine timing, door locking, airbags, and advanced driver aid systems. The use of microphones and other gadgets for eavesdropping and obtaining control of the car is expected to rise in 2023 as more driverless vehicles hit the road. 8. The new target is mobileIn 2019, cybersecurity trends predicted a significant increase in mobile banking malware or assaults, making our mobile devices a target for hackers. This has come to pass. Individuals are more at risk from all of our images, financial transactions, emails, and communications. A smartphone virus or malware may be the focus of cybersecurity developments in 2023. 9. Data breach a high-priority targetData will continue to be a source of concern for businesses worldwide. For individuals or corporations, securing digital data is a major issue. Hackers might exploit any small flaw or fault in your system browser or software to gain access to personal information.10. Threats from withinHuman error is one of the most prevalent reasons for data breaches. A single bad day or purposeful flaw may bring an entire corporation down, resulting in millions of dollars in stolen data. Hence, make sure that staff are aware of the need to secure data in every way possible."

From their vast Soysambu ranch to their dairy business, the Delamere’s have been the topic of discussion for many years.Although they have contributed significantly to the Kenyan agricultural sector, the family’s controversies have overshadowed their achievements. This article will take a closer look at the Delamere family’s history, controversies, and contributions.HistoryThe Delamere family’s history dates back to the early 20th century when the first Lord Delamere settled in Kenya. He first came to Kenya in the late 19th century to explore his passion for hunting. Despite being attacked by a lion, he fell in love with the country’s beauty and settled there. He ventured into farming, and although he experienced numerous failures, he did not give up. Unfortunately, he died bankrupt.Following his father’s death, Thomas Cholmondeley eventually moved to Kenya after World War II and turned Soysambu into a successful ranch amidst numerous challenges. He would be credited in several publications for contributing much to the Kenyan Agricultural sector. Following his death, his only son Hugh inherited the ranch.Controversies The Delamere family has been involved in several controversies, most notably the infamous case of Tom Delamere shooting and killing two people on their ranch. This led to a boycott of their dairy products, forcing them to lease their dairy business to Brookside and move some of their stock to Njoro. The family has also been speculated to have sold their milk business to Brookside, which is majority-owned by the Kenyatta family. In 2017, it was reported that Brookside had acquired the Delamere yogurt brand.Subdividing the PropertyIn 2013, the Delamere family subdivided their Naivasha farm as part of a succession plan and registered a new company to inherit their livestock and real estate properties. The family also donated some of their lands to a local school and sold some to retiring staff at discounted prices. The Delamere family leased part of their land to various hospitality businesses.Sale to Brookside The Delamere family’s dairy business has been in the spotlight for many years. In 2017, Business Daily reported that Brookside had acquired the Delamere yogurt brand. Although details of the deal remained scanty, an event held by Delamere to launch the new yogurt varieties further served to prove they had sold to Brookside. The famous yogurt brand is now under the Kenyatta-owned company.Donating and Selling Part of the LandPart of the vast Delamere estate was donated to a local school named after the family matriarch Lady Ann Delamere. A further 5,000 acres were subdivided and sold to retiring staff at discounted prices by a local Sacco. The family was too, later on, sell 300 acres to the government near Nakuru town that hosts Delamere Girls and an airstrip. The Delamere’s leased part of their land to Serena hotel, Mawe mbili camp, and Mbweha camp."

He became a social media sensation in 2021 as part of Eric Omondi’s “Wife Material” crew. He was then working as the comedian’s chauffeur.Since then, Ogada has been the mechanic of choice for various Kenyan celebrities such as Jalang’o, Eve Mungai, 2mbili, Kaligraph, Ringtone, and others. However, like most success stories, Ogada’s is one of “from rags to riches.”KCSE star who scored A now working as mechanic to save for university feesBorn in Oyugis Nyanza, Ogada attended Pondo Secondary, where he did his KCSE and got a C plain.he says.After completing his form 4 in 2010, Ogada moved to Nairobi after some altercations with the village chief. A naïve villager, he thought life in the city would be one of constant partying, fun, and pomp.He was gravely disappointed.He says he was initially hosted by his uncle, who lived in Kibera then. After hosting him for a few days, the uncle introduced him to mjengo projects so he could learn to hassle for himself.says the mechanic.Ogada’s passion for cars started when he was still in the village. One day, a pickup delivering construction materials to his home stalled. No one in Oyugis had the faintest idea of what could be wrong with the vehicle.9 signs your car needs to see a professional mechanic for a tune-upConsequently, it stalled for two days until a mechanic was sent from Kisumu to fix it.Says the mechanic.During the pickup’s repair, Ogada was very curious and kept asking the mechanic questions about what he was doing.While strolling in Nairobi streets looking for mjengo projects, Ogada met a friend who said he was working as an apprentice mechanic. Ogada asked whether he could accompany him to his garage since he also wanted to know how to be a mechanic.He accompanied the apprentice to Kibera’s fort Jesus area, where he met the garage owner. To teach Ogada, the garage owner demanded ksh 54,000.Says Ogada.He sold two of his village cows in the village, raised ksh 30 000, sent the money to the garage owner, and the classes began.After working for six months in the garage, Ogada and his fellow apprentices were dismissed after a client complained that some parts of his vehicle had been stolen in the garage.Beware of these mechanic rip-offs when taking your car for check upThe mechanic found another position with another garage, where he says his salary was ksh 150 per week. He worked in the garage for two years.While there, he realized that most mechanics specialized in repairing Japanese vehicles, leaving a massive gap for German and British machines – especially range rovers.Ever the opportunist, Ogada decided to learn about range rovers and how to repair them. His connections led him to another garage that had a steady supply of clients who owned range rovers.After explaining his plight, the garage owner – named Ken – agreed to teach him about range rovers. However, he would only be paid for repairing Japanese cars, not range rovers.Ogada worked in Ken’s garage for about 6months, after which he got connections to work in a bigger garage.Henceforth, he washed his hands off Japanese vehicles and started specializing in range rovers.Ogada’s first celebrity client was Eric Omondi, whom he says he met while working at Ken’s garage. The comedian had brought his range rover for repair.However, at that time, client-mechanic relationships were frowned upon by Ogada’s employer, so he did not talk a lot with Eric.Why mechanic who stole Uhuru’s car was sentenced to deathThe duo met later when Eric’s Range Rover stalled on Mombasa Road.says the mechanic.His fame as Ogada Rovers rose during Eric Omondi’s controversial “wife material” show. When Eric was arrested, Ogada was working as his chauffeur at the time. During the altercations at Central police station, Eric introduced him to other celebrities.In 2020, Ogada partnered with fellow mechanics to form a garage called King rovers, where he worked for three years.He then opened his garage, dubbed Ogada Rovers. Here, he has employed six workers.he says.He owns four vehicles: A Mercedes, a Range Rover, a Subaru, and a Mitsubishi. His dream car is an Audi TT.says the father of two.He attributes his achievements to hard work and acceptance. While other mechanics would shy off at wearing overalls, wondering what others would think about them, Ogada says he always wants everyone to know he is a mechanic.His advice to upcoming mechanics is to know what they want in life, embrace opportunities, and respect others."

They know how to read palms and are not different from palm readers. They can look at you and tell you about your past, things that happened many years ago in your family tree and you think this is a prophet,” he is seen saying in a video of the service shared online.“How many people in Jesus’ lifetime did Jesus tell about their past? There are certain things that have nothing to do with the gospel. God is not a magician and does not use your past to manipulate you. That is why we need to carry our guns and defend our faith,” he added.Although it was not established if the rifle was loaded, the Nigeria Police Force has spoken out on the incident, saying it will investigate the pastor.Olumuyiwa Adejobi, the Force’s Public Relations Officer, said AK-47 rifles fall under the prohibited firearms in the West African state and only certain law enforcement officers are allowed to do carry them.In a series of tweets, Adejobi termed the incident as “shocking” and said the case had been forwarded to higher authorities for investigations.“…if its true, the pastor will have a case to answer. AK47??. It falls under prohibited Firearms in Nigeria, and no one bears it except an officer of the law, and not all of them have the right, selected sec operatives, but no individual has the right to bear it,” he wrote."

Let me hear their voices if for a moment.”His friend sobs back: “I am driving… I am coming to you… Brother, I am coming.”Avci then kisses the hand of the rescuer who is holding the phone and thanks him. “May God be happy with you a thousand times,” he says.Koca, the minister, said both Avci and a second man, Mehmet Ali Sakiroglu, 26, were rescued around the same time from under the ruins of a private hospital building.Sakiroglu had been at the hospital for a check-up when the quake struck, his father told CNN affiliate CNN Turk.The two men were found when a rescue team spotted a leg dangling from a pile of rubble after a machine operator cleared the surface debris.The men were taken to Hatay’s makeshift hospital for treatment, the health minister said.CNN’s Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, who is in southern Turkey, said it was unusual for people to survive more than 100 hours trapped in rubble and most successful rescues usually occurred within 24 hours.“These are remarkable stories and people rise up… in these situations,” he said.The rescue of the two men follows that of a 13-year-old boy named Mustafa in Antakya, Hatay province, on Wednesday – 228 hours after the quake struck.Mustafa’s survival was “certainly a miracle,” rescue worker Özer Aydinli told Gupta in an interview on Thursday.Aydinli said he thought his fellow rescue workers were “hallucinating,” and he assumed the boy had “died with his eyes open.” But the child cried out, “Brother! I don’t feel my legs. Save me!”A crew of more than 70 people then rushed over to help.“Even now, we get tears in our eyes from time to time,” Aydinli said, referring to the boy’s rescue. “He is quite well and conscious. Hopefully, he will get better.”Rescue teams are still trying to access hard-to-reach areas of Turkey and Syria, but the number of people being found alive is dwindling.Meanwhile, though donations are pouring in from all over the world, many survivors have been left homeless in near-freezing winter temperatures with a lack of access to basic necessities.“A lot of lives have been saved, a lot of people have been pulled from rubble by their neighbors, by their friends, by their sons, daughters, mothers, fathers. Frontline health workers have done amazing work in both countries,” the World Health Organization’s (WHO) emergencies director, Mike Ryan, told a briefing in Geneva on Wednesday.WHO said it was particularly concerned for people in northwestern Syria, a rebel-held region with little access to aid.The United Nations’ health agency said it had asked Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to open more border crossing points with Turkey to allow aid in.“It’s clear that the zone of greatest concern at the moment is the area of northwestern Syria,” Ryan said.Delivering aid to Syria has been limited by restrictions on the cross-border mechanism agreed by the UN Security Council resolution in 2014 to allow aid to cross four places on the Turkey-Syria border.“The impact of the earthquake in areas of Syria controlled by the government is significant, but the services are there and there is access to those people,” Ryan said.“We have to remember here that in Syria, we’ve had 10 years of war. The health system is amazingly fragile. People have been through hell.”"

These attempts started way back in June last year; those efforts have not ceased. William Ruto is on record saying that he must take over Jubilee,” said Kioni.On Wednesday, Jubilee NEC members and Parliamentarians who have switched their allegiance to President William Ruto arrived at the Jubilee Party officers and took charge of operations after the Registrar of Political Parties ratified the ouster of Kioni, Vice Chairman David Murathe and National Treasurer Kagwe Gichohi, pursuant to resolutions of the Nakuru NEC meeting last week.Kioni and the ousted party officials however contested the legality of the Nakuru meeting at the Political Parties Dispute Tribunal (PPDT).In a verdict rendered by its Chairperson Desma Nungo on Thursday, the tribunal shelved the change of guard pending the hearing and determination of the application.“We have come here to show solidarity with members of the Jubilee Party. We want to ask the people of Kenya to wake up to the fact that the country is in serious trouble, and there's no reason whatsoever for anyone to imagine that things will get better,” Mr. Odinga said on Thursday at the new Jubilee headquarters, flanked by Kioni.“Everything we ever fought for and won is threatened. Kenya Kwanza administration has launched an all-out assault on our hard won multiparty democracy. It's out to weaken political parties. We've never seen this kind of spirited assault on our democracy since 1992.”Former President Uhuru Kenyatta, who is the Jubilee Party leader, has maintained a studious silence on the wrangles that continue to besiege his political outfit.Kioni has hit out at jubilee leaders who have joined ranks with the ruling coalition, saying their move will not weaken the party’s resolve to support Mr. Odinga’s push for electoral reforms."

The work of the police is to serve and protect and not to oversee the damage of property,” he said.According to Gachagua, before evicting the families, police should have deliberated on ways to temporarily relocate them to new grounds.  “If there is a court order they should take it to a police intelligence committee so they can deliberate on where the evicted persons will go,” he said.The DP added that the police commander who led the operation, Nakuru County Police Commander Peter Mwanzo, has since been recalled to NPS' headquarters and that the state will take action against him.“Any police commander who conducts such evictions without consulting the County security and intelligence committee will be acting alone. We’ve already removed the county police commander who oversaw the operations and we will take action against him,” said Gachagua.“I want to tell officers who have such habits to change immediately. The regime of oppression and brutal evictions is a thing of the past since the current government cares.” "

By then, it was only a railway stop between Mombasa and Uganda. However, over a millennium later, the city remains a key transport hub for the East African Region. In addition, Kisumu has the recognition as key and the first-millennium city from the United Nations. The city has a rich cultural history where different tribes called the town different names. The Luo people referred to it as ""Kisumo"" meaning ""a place to look for food"", the Abaluhya referenced it as ""Abhasuma"" meaning ""a place to borrow food"". Further, the Abagusii called it ""egesumu"" to mean ""a structure for keeping or rearing chicken"".  Additionally, the Nandi referred to it as ""Kisumett"" which means a place where food was found during times of scarcity and exchange.Kisumu City enjoys the advantage of robust tourism, strategic location, infrastructure, positive demographics, positive economic growth and a rich culture. These are among the few factors causing massive growth of the real estate sector in the town.To begin with, the popularity of Kisumu real estate market is currently being driven by the county’s tourism sector. These include wildlife, camping, business meetings, rich Luo culture, exciting fish dishes, beach visits, and boat rides. This is leading to a rise in demand for holiday homes, hotels, Airbnbs etc. This is also causing a rise in the general hospitality industry in Kisumu. The strategic location is also playing a key role in this city which is a key transport hub in Nyanza and Western Region. The town enjoys a robust and diverse transport system via road, railway, and air through Kisumu International Airport. This makes it convenient to travel to and from Kisumu from any part of the country. Growing infrastructure is also another key factor leading to the growth of the real estate sector. This is leading to the rise in demand for properties for sale in Kisumu.  Over the past decade, the city has been enjoying key infrastructural projects such as revival of the railway line, Kisumu port, construction of Jomo Kenyatta International Stadium, upgrading of the Airport to international standards, construction of a number of interchanges etc. Collectively, 117 key infrastructural projects have been completed in Kisumu out of the planned 309. Gradually, this is causing a facelift in this key city located next to a lake.Positive economic growth is another key factor leading to the growth of Kisumu real estate market. The city envisions a sustainable, innovative and dynamic city through a recent physical development plan. Further, the World Bank-funded Kenya Urban Support Programme (KUSP) is helping improve the city’s infrastructure and key amenities. Additionally, Kisumu is set aside as a Special Economic Zone by the World Bank. This basically means the region will become a hub for manufacturing, industries and accessories processing. This will further spur developments in the entire region.Realtors such as Username Investments are now setting base in Kisumu city. This is after intensive research on the current real estate trends in Kisumu County. The company is offering eighth-acre and quarter-acre plots for sale in Kisumu. The land has key amenities such as water, electricity and graded access road thus ideal for immediate residential development.The project dubbed The Domain, Kisumu Dala is located in Kibos along Mamboleo - Miwani tarmac road. The property shares great proximity to Kibos Sugar Company. The project nears the Great Lakes University of Kisumu (GLUK) main campus, Makini Schools among others. Reuben Kimani, the CEO of Username Investments, says “Kisumu City is hub for East Africa developments and anyone looking for the best place to invest in real estate should invest in Kisumu. The CEO foresees Kisumu becoming the go-to city in terms of all investments due to the city’s strategic location as a business hub for the East African Community."

The body of a policeman was found on Saturday evening.The report also disclosed that three land cruisers, among other vehicles, used by the officers had their tyres deflated, and suffered significant damage after being razed down by bandits when police disembarked to pursue them in the bushes.Turkana County Commander Samuel Ndanyi said that despite the exchange, his officers managed to recover a mobile phone, 31 rounds of ammunition, cash, a solar panel and footwear belonging to the bandits.The injured officers were treated at Kainuk dispensary before being referred to the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret, Uasin Gishu County, for specialised treatment.Banditry along the highway is on the rise with several motorists and passengers shot dead and robbed off their veluables over the last month.The latest incident involved the killing of three people, including a high school student, that happened along the same spot.They were on board a Lodwar-bound public service vehicle that started its journey in Kitale.Transport along the highway remains paralysed and businesses in towns dotting it remain shut for fear of bandit attacks."

We are not in a State of Emergency, no way a civilian can be harassed in that manner. You shouldn't treat Matiangi as a criminal...he hasn't refused to be charged....follow procedure,” said Mr. Odinga.Kisii Governor Simba Arati said: “Hili suala la Matiang’i...Ata kama ni kilema, ata kama ni macho moja, ni mtoto wetu hapa Kisii...serikali mkiwa na shida tafadhali muite Matiang’i...chochote kitakachomfanyikia Matiang’i wewe Ruto ndio tutauliza.”During the Wednesday operation, police carried away CCTV monitors and hard disks, ostensibly to aid in investigations over an alleged raid a week ago.The Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) is yet to disclose the nature or particular allegations of probe on matiang’i.Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka stated: “Issue ya Matiang’i kuhangaishwa ni fitina kabisa kabisa. Matiang’i was not just a minister from Kisii...he was a strong man...badala ya kumuomba atoe ushauri.

The leadership of this country shall be picked through choices made by people of Kenya and through the ballot,” he stated.“We shall remain true to multiparty state as opposed to single party rule.

For example, one of the provisions in the act allows a full opt-out at the Tier II level of contributions for employers who have or are contributing to pension schemes approved by the Retirement Benefits Authority. But the process to opt out is flawed with bureaucracy.Enwealth Financial Services CEO, Mr. Simon Wafubwa called for simplicity of the opt-out option for schemes saying as it is, it will create a refunds nightmare between employers and NSSF.Employers are required to start making contributions this month yet their applications to opt-out will not be done immediately.The Act has provided for an opt-out option for any occupational retirement benefits scheme including an umbrella retirement benefits scheme or an individual retirement benefits scheme that has been approved and registered by the RBA for purposes of receiving Tier II Contributions.The employer has to make a written request to the Authority at least 60 days before opting to contract out.“In our view, there is a necessity to amend the act to be very simple in terms of opt-out. If you have already complied with RBA regulations, there should be no requirement to apply to be exempted. It should be by default.""That should be an issue of compliance for audit, rather than applying and then waiting for two months or months to get approval and then pursue NSSF for refunds. It is just too much bureaucracy,” said Mr. Wafubwa when Enwealth Financial Services hosted a forum for employers and trustees in Nairobi on Friday to unpack the enacted NSSF 2013 act.Contributions in the first 5 years shall be deducted in accordance with the two-Tier system. Tier I contribution is to be pegged on the lower earnings limit and is required to be deducted and paid to the NSSF.Tier II contributions are calculated at 6% of the employee’s pensionable earnings between the lower-earning limits and the upper-earning limits as per the earning limits.Many contributors may choose to opt out of the NSSF Tier II because of lower administration expenses looking for fees below NSSF’s which have been over 2%.Private schemes have been able to deliver annual returns of over 10% which is often double the returns by NSSF, as well as more transparency in management and faster processing of claims. RBA ensures members receive their claims within 30 days of application after retirement.“For employers who do not have a scheme, you may have to set up one or join an umbrella scheme which has been approved by the RBA for the purpose of obtaining an exemption for remittance of Tier II contributions,” added Mr. Wafubwa.Currently, there are about 3 million active contributors in pension including through NSSF, with the private sector having about 850,000 members. The NSSF act of 2013 targets to bring the informal sector into the pension fold estimating the memberships will increase to about 15 million.Kenya's current income replacement ratio falls between 1-4% as savings are insufficient, and eroded by inflation and high administrative costs.RBA’s Deputy Manager, Supervision, Caroline Wanjala Wabwire spoke during the event: “This is a welcome move for the country as we have been grappling with issues of coverage with only about 25% of the labor force covered by a retirement benefits arrangement.Contributions to NSSF have been not affording Kenyans adequate benefits at retirement. This will increase the Income replacement Ratio to about 40% which is closer to International Labour Organisation's recommended 50-60%,” added Wabwire."

She further alleges that the doctors who attended to her wished her away and withdrew all other documents from her,” stated the report.She then filed a report at the Bungoma Police Stations, upon which officers embarked on a mission to find the missing baby. Nakhumincha was later found with the baby while in the company of the other co-accused persons.“DCI team from Bungoma South commenced investigations whereas at around 11 pm at Bungoma township, one Joseline Nakhumincha Simiyu was found in possession of stolen unnamed baby while in the company of other three women and one man,"" the police noted.They were arrested and have been in custody for one week.Judge Mutai said the accused were granted the bond after their lawyers assured them they were law-abiding citizens and could not run away.The case will be mentioned on April 17, 2023 and heard on June 6, 2023."

While there does exist scepticism surrounding education through the internet, massive progress has been made to discount that.The notion of leaving behind a classroom may sound absurd to many, especially Generation X, but, over time, strides have been made that have seen students perform exceptionally well and online teaching become a huge success.In 2020, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, most educational institutions transitioned to online learning. Although this transition flew in the face of in-person learning, it also brought to light the advantages of online learning for students.One of the main benefits of online learning is flexibility. It allows people to easily manage multiple commitments at once–such as work and family life. When it comes to work, learners don’t have to put their careers on hold to earn a world-class education.This basically means that individuals can work at their own pace, allowing them to manage their obligations suitably while also optimizing the retention of the information being taught.A top American University noted, “You can work through the lesson plan at your own pace to ensure you’re mastering the material before moving on to the next section. This added flexibility allows online learners to move through the course work at their speed and get the most out of the degree program.”Another advantage of online learning is time management and honing such skills. With the flexibility offered by online classes, students can create their schedules. It is up to the individual to stay on track with assignments and deadlines and learn how to manage the demands of said classes.Online courses also allow students to plan and work ahead, which can be particularly beneficial for those who are also managing the demands of their career, such as travel. In the instance of travel, they can work ahead to complete the necessary work, or bring their electronic device with them to keep up with their assignments.Last, but not least, there is affordability. Unlike in-person education methods, online education tends to be more affordable. There’s also often a wide range of payment options that let you pay in instalments, which allows for better budget management.Many Kenyans have been moving towards online learning as a way of maximizing their time, saving money, meeting their responsibilities, and managing their lives better.Kenya is one of Africa’s leading technological hubs, where the mobile internet penetration rate stands at 83% (and rapidly growing) in comparison to 23% for the rest of sub-Saharan Africa, according to data from GSMA, the industry lobby for mobile network operators globally.A 2020 article in Business Daily noted that Kenya has managed to stay ahead of the curve by laying the groundwork for e-learning through investments in ICT infrastructure, digital literacy, digital content and upskilling of teachers and trainers.One of the main universities Kenyans are taking a greater interest in is Nexford University, a leading global stalwart in e-learning.Nexford is on a path to becoming one of the most affordable online American universities in the world by positively impacting millions through education, and by providing students with the skills they need to develop and achieve their goals.It provides an educational model based on mastery of relevant workplace competencies by applying communication, critical thinking and problem-solving skills to build a foundation of lifelong learning.Nexford also offers an educational experience that maximizes a student's opportunities for success - by offering flexibility, learner support and affordability.Seeing is believing. Check out a top Nexford student Hesbon Oenga, a BBA learner from Kenya speak about his experience at Nexford University.See all that Nexford has to offer by visiting their website."

Their file awaits action by the DPP.The commission is also handling a corruption related case at the NSSF, where the anti-graft body says there was misappropriation of public funds in the award of a tender to Beldavo Enterprises Ltd.EACC says on October 4, 2022, a report compiled and forwarded to the DPP recommended the evaluation committee members, acting procurement manager and the directors of Beldavo Enterprises Ltd be charged with offences of conspiracy to commit an offence of corruption. The DPP is yet to take action on the file.The DPP is also yet to take any action on a land fraud case in Kwale County where land officials in Mombasa, Kwale and Nairobi allegedly conspired to transact land transfers using forged title deeds.The EACC further says there is an active case on their desk, following the irregular award of a tender amounting to millions of shillings in Machakos County for desilting Maruba Dam.The commission is also in pursuit of Ksh.12 million in Taita Taveta County where a county official embezzled the amount in form of imprests that have never been returned.

Ingraham responded, “Sidney is a complete nut. No one will work with her. Ditto with Rudy [Giuliani].”The messages also revealed that Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of Fox Corporation, did not believe Trump’s election lies and even floated the idea of having Carlson, Hannity, and Ingraham appear together in prime time to declare Joe Biden as the rightful winner of the election.Such an act, Murdoch said, “Would go a long way to stop the Trump myth that the election stolen.”The court document offered the most vivid picture to date of the chaos that transpired behind the scenes at Fox News after Trump lost the election and viewers rebelled against the right-wing channel for accurately calling the contest in Biden’s favor.Dominion filed its mammoth lawsuit against Fox News in March 2021, alleging that during the 2020 presidential election the talk network “recklessly disregarded the truth” and pushed various pro-Donald Trump conspiracy theories about the election technology company because “the lies were good for Fox’s business.”Fox News has not only vigorously denied Dominion’s claims, it has insisted it is “proud” of its 2020 election coverage.In a statement Thursday night, Fox News argued that the court filing contained cherry-picked quotes lacking context.“There will be a lot of noise and confusion generated by Dominion and their opportunistic private equity owners, but the core of this case remains about freedom of the press and freedom of speech, which are fundamental rights afforded by the Constitution and protected by New York Times v. Sullivan,” the network said.But the court document provided a mountain of evidence exposing Fox News as a right-wing talk channel void of the most basic journalistic ethics.The legal filing also underscored how worried Fox News executives and hosts were in the immediate aftermath of the election of losing its viewership to Newsmax, a smaller right-wing talk channel that was saturating its airwaves with election denialism.After the election, a furious Trump attacked Fox News and encouraged his followers to switch to Newsmax. And, in the days and weeks after the presidential contest had been called, they did just that. Fox News shed a chunk of its audience while Newsmax gained significant viewership.In multiple instances, Fox News executives and hosts expressed worry over the matter and started to crack down on those at the network who fact-checked election lies. In one case, after White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich fact-checked a Trump tweet pushing election fraud, Carlson said he wanted her fired.In multiple instances, Fox News executives and hosts expressed worry over the matter and started to crack down on those at the network who fact-checked election lies — even as the messages show that Fox News’ chief political anchor, Bret Baier, pushed for such fact checks. In one case, after White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich fact-checked a Trump tweet pushing election fraud, Carlson said he wanted her fired.“Please get her fired,” Carlson told Hannity over text message. “Seriously … what the f**k? I’m actually shocked … It needs to stop immediately, like tonight. It’s measurably hurting the company.”Hannity replied that he had already spoken to Suzanne Scott, the network’s chief executive. The next morning, Heinrich’s tweet had been deleted.A person with direct knowledge of the matter told CNN that Heinrich was blindsided reading the details in the legal filing and was not aware of the efforts by top hosts behind the scenes to get her fired.In another case, when host Neil Cavuto cut away from a White House press briefing where election misinformation was being promoted, senior Fox News leadership were told such a move presented a “brand threat.”Scott exchanged messages with Lachlan Murdoch, the Fox Corporation chief executive, and outlined a plan to win viewers back. Scott said the right-wing talk channel would “highlight our stars and plant flags letting the viewers know we hear them and respect them.” Murdoch responded that the brand needed “rebuilding without any missteps.”Soon after, Fox News debuted a new “standing up for what’s right” marketing campaign featuring the network’s top stars.Despite what appeared on air, Fox News executives and hosts privately criticized the Trump camp for pushing claims of election fraud, the messages showed. Hannity even said Giuliani was “acting like an insane person” and Ingraham described him as “an idiot.” Rupert Murdoch said it was “really bad” that Giuliani was advising Trump.The court filing also revealed that Fox News executives had criticized some of the network’s top talent behind the scenes. Jay Wallace, the network president, said that “the North Koreans” did a “more nuanced show” than then-host Lou Dobbs. Jerry Andrews, the executive producer of “Justice with Judge Jeanine,” referred to host Jeanine Pirro as “nuts.”"

Is it wrong for a Pokot to own a chopper?” Posed Pkosing.The Pokot South MP reading foul play in the manner the banditry menace in the North Rift is being handled by the State.“Other leaders from neighbouring communities have incited their constituents, why aren't they being questioned as well?” He asked.Detectives from the DCI have informed the third-term MP that they will contact him on Monday if need be for further clarification, even as security apparatus entered the regions classified as disturbed and dangerous to launch a major operation aimed at weeding out bandits."

Sheikh Jassim has strong connections, however, to the seemingly bottomless pockets that have made Qatar one of the world's top investors.The sheikh, the son of former Qatari prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, is the longstanding chairman of Qatar Islamic Bank (QIB) and was educated at Sandhurst, the elite British military academy.His bid statement said he graduated as an ""officer cadet"".'Life-long fan' It also stated that Jassim is ""a life-long Manchester United fan"" but gave few other details.The sheikh was born in 1982, the year that QIB was established. He joined the bank's board in his early 20s and has been chairman for much of QIB's rise to become a leading Islamic financial institution.As Qatar's wealth has skyrocketed, QIB has introduced women-only bank branches and sharia-compliant insurance and other products for women.It has also helped build giant shopping malls and the sheikh's rare public comments have concentrated on reaffirming the bank's commitment to its ""diversification"" away from oil and gas and bolstering its private sector.QIB, which has $50 billion in assets, posted a net profit of over $1 billion in 2022, more than 12 percent up on the year and having shown a dramatic increase in the past decade.Sheikh Jassim cut his banking teeth as a board member until 2017 at international giant Credit Suisse, where the Qatar Investment Authority, the state sovereign wealth fund, is the second biggest shareholder.The would-be football supremo is one of the 15 children of Sheikh Hamad, prime minister from 2007 to 2013, who set up the investment fund that bankrolled the purchase of Paris Saint-Germain football club and London landmarks such as Harrods department store and the Shard skyscraper.Sheikh Hamad, who is known as HBJ, was close to former emir, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, who was instrumental in Qatar's massive investment in major sports events such as the World Cup and buying into clubs and sports rights.Sheikh Hamad has his own business empire which has made him a billionaire and is known to be passionate about football.Qatar's ownership of Paris Saint-Germain could prove a block to Sheikh Jassim's ambitions to take over Manchester United. European governing body UEFA does not allow two clubs competing in the same competition to be owned by the same entity.Qatar's advisers have expressed confidence, however, that any objections to another English Premier League club falling under Middle East control can be overcome.The Qatari bid faces opposition from British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe, the only other bidder to have officially declared an interest."

The work of the police is to serve and protect and not to oversee the damage of property,” he said.According to Gachagua, before evicting the families, police should have deliberated on ways to temporarily relocate them to new grounds.  “If there is a court order they should take it to a police intelligence committee so they can deliberate on where the evicted persons will go,” he said.The DP added that the police commander who led the operation, Nakuru County Police Commander Peter Mwanzo, has since been recalled to NPS' headquarters and that the state will take action against him.“Any police commander who conducts such evictions without consulting the County security and intelligence committee will be acting alone. We’ve already removed the county police commander who oversaw the operations and we will take action against him,” said Gachagua.“I want to tell officers who have such habits to change immediately. The regime of oppression and brutal evictions is a thing of the past since the current government cares.” "

The stock closed down 28%.“The board is not aware of any information that indicates that Mr. Bao’s unavailability is or might be related to the business and/or operations of the group,” the firm said in the filing.Bao is known as a veteran dealmaker in China’s tech industry. He helped broker the 2015 merger between two of the country’s leading food delivery services, Meituan and Dianping.Today, the combined company’s “super app” platform is ubiquitous in China.Bao started his investment banking career in the late 1990s at Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse and later went on to serve as an adviser to the stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen.His team has also invested in US-listed Chinese electric vehicle makers Nio and Li Auto, and helped Chinese internet giants Baidu and JD.com complete their secondary listings in Hong Kong.Bao did not immediately respond to messages from CNN on WeChat on Friday, while China Renaissance hasn’t yet responded to a request for comment.The financial services firm recently dealt with another similar disruption, according to Caixin, a respected Chinese financial news outlet. Chinese authorities detained Cong Lin, the company’s president, in September, it reported, citing unidentified sources.China has a history of detaining execsBao’s disappearance follows those of other high-profile business leaders in China, where it is not uncommon for executives to suddenly drop off the radar with little explanation.In 2020, real estate tycoon Ren Zhiqiang disappeared for several months after he allegedly spoke out against Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.Ren was eventually jailed for 18 years on corruption charges.In 2017, insurance giant Anbang warned shareholders that its chairman, Wu Xiaohui, wouldn’t be able to carry out his duties after he was reportedly detained by authorities as part of a government investigation.Anbang at the time cited “personal reasons” for his absence. Wu was eventually jailed for 18 years,Also in 2017, Xiao Jianhua, a tycoon who controlled Tomorrow Holdings, was seized by Chinese security agents from his room at the Four Seasons hotel in Hong Kong and taken to mainland China. He was sentenced in August 2022 to 13 years in prison.Another prominent case took place in 2015, when Guo Guangchang, the billionaire dubbed “the Warren Buffett of China,” was reported as missing by the conglomerate he ran.That group, Fosun, later confirmed that Guo was assisting authorities in an investigation.Senior executives from dozens of Chinese companies also disappeared that year. Some later returned to their positions, while others did not."

Launched in partnership with Stanford Seed in 2021, AMI’s Aspire Business Growth Programme provides owners of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and their senior teams with practical learning and training to power growth in their business with 88% of graduates attributing accelerated business growth to the programme. “Partnering with AMI to offer the Aspire Business Growth Programme has expanded our ability to reach more SMEs across Africa, while also preparing businesses to be positioned to join Stanford Seed’s Transformation Program for established CEOs and founders,” said Darius Teter, Seed Executive Director.“Evidence shows that small and early-stage businesses are in need of more tailored support. Through Aspire we’re able to offer support to entrepreneurs at an earlier stage of their journey through AMI’s practical programme built specifically for African business owners.’’Designed for business owners with annual revenue of between $20,000 - $400,000 USD, Aspire is delivered virtually over a six-month learning journey, with participating businesses joining pan-African cohorts of 30 businesses. The programme offers access to AMI’s practical business tools and resources through experiential workshops, online platform access, and peer groups, in addition to a live session delivered by Stanford Seed Graduate School of Business Faculty. Access to Stanford Seed mentors is offered to a select number of participants who operate high-performing businesses that successfully complete all the programme requirements.“Aspire draws on AMI’s business growth methodology and practical learning approach that has proven to help African businesses grow and thrive,” said Rebecca Harrison, CEO and Co-founder of AMI.“The Aspire programme is designed for small-to-medium sized businesses(SMEs) who benefit from learnings focused on five key pillars including Strategy & Planning; Customers & Markets; Finance & Money; People & Talent and Operations Efficiency.”Thousands of well-established SMEs generating revenue between $300,000 - $15M USD have applied to Stanford Seed’s flagship programme, the Seed Transformation Program (STP), but the programme admits only a select few. Originally offered as an alternative option for African businesses that do not meet the minimum requirements, AMI and Seed have opened the application process for the Aspire Business Growth Programme to businesses across the continent after a successful pilot. 130 businesses have enrolled in the programme so far with 88% of participants that complete, attributing their business growth to the programme.“In 2021 our business was at a stagnant state, we were not growing and we didn't know what to do next. The Aspire programme gave us a 360-degree look at the business. The tools were a game changer,"" said Raphael Opiyo Obiero, Founder of Nawiri African Sprouts Ltd and  Aspire Programme participant ""Before Aspire we kept postponing decisions as we run the day-to-day operations of the business, but now we have a way of making both big and small decisions and more importantly bringing people on board to the decisions. Our revenue has grown, our business continues to grow thanks to Aspire’’"

It said it has protested and requested explanations from Beijing."

This is after the deadline he was given by President William Ruto to abandon former Prime Minister Raila Odinga’s revolution against his government or lose his retirement perks almost elapses.However, all is not lost for Uhuru as some Jubilee legislators have expressed their willingness to talk sense into him.Led by former Cheragany Member of Parliament Joshua Kutuny, the lawmakers indicated that they had hatched plans to engage the former commander-in-chief to chart a way forward on his future.Uhuru risks losing his nearly Ksh700 million retirement perk, with Jubilee rebel members pushing him to either quit the party or work with Ruto. “Within the same period, we hope that our party leader (Uhuru Kenyatta) will reach out so that we can explain to him why we want to exit. “We have been frustrated because our members have been denied some positions in Parliament, and that is what has engineered all these, “Joshua Kutuny told Nation.According to the MPs, their discourse would help save Uhuru from being sidelined after Jubilee exits Azimio. It would also help him secure his retirement perks.This comes even as Uhuru has indicated his willingness to turn down the perks.During the burial of former Education Cabinet Secretary Prof. George Omore Magoha, he pledged his loyalty to Raila.The Kenyan DAILY POST."

They are political meetings disguised as prayer meetings. Unfortunately, the church has been hoodwinked. Pastors and Bishops are political brokers on hire by a political class. They are on their payrolls. A very sad state of the church. The salt has lost its taste and the light its brightness,” Rev.

He picked up an initial fine of $1,000 (£890) and was ordered to pay $2,000 (£1,780) in compensation to the two anti-hate campaign groups.‘I’m hurt because this doesn’t represent me,’ Evra told The Times this week. ‘Yes, I used vulgar language because when I was growing up this was normal. It makes me think I have so much to learn but I will keep learning.‘The police were laughing because they know I didn’t use the words [to be offensive]. They say we don’t have to pursue the case because we know who Patrice is.‘It was a private message, I used words that were used when I was a kid. It was the way I grew up.’Despite his criminal conviction, Evra claimed that the complainants were ‘picking a battle with the wrong guy’.It was a private message, I used words that were used when I was a kid. It was the way I grew up. The problem is you have to adapt. It is a new world. I apologised straight away because I could see I offended people,’ he continued.‘For four years they fight but they are picking the battle with the wrong guy if you see what I have done all my life, which is to accept everyone for who they are.‘It’s painful because it’s not who I am. I have to pay those two associations and I hope they are going to use the money for good things but it is not just about the money, it’s about me being in this situation when I am not that person.‘I made a mistake. In my youth it was not a mistake and now it is. Since that incident I have never used those words.‘I have acknowledged the homophobia problem in the football world so it’s really crazy for me to get this bad press for something I did four years ago.‘It was not because I meant it, I just used those words. I offended people, I apologised many times.‘I lost the case, and I paid them and I am fine with that. But I am not fine with people trying to describe an image I am not.’Following Thursday’s conviction, the complainants’ lawyer, Etienne Deshoulieres, released a statement saying: ‘The homophobic remarks of a personality like Patrice Evra fuel hatred and violence against LGBT people, in particular in countries where homosexuality is criminally repressed, like in Senegal, the country where Patrice Evra comes from.”"

If you look at the cars ministers use, why do we need fuel guzzlers? Why can’t we go to 2000cc? Let us cut on the loot we see in this country…. cut on expenditure and make corruption very expensive,” said Dr. Wainaina.“Imprison 10 serious guys and take their wealth and that of their families. Kenyans will fear corruption. But when we see our leaders live a certain life, all of us will live like that. leaders create cultures. And one of the cultures the president would do is to declare his wealth. Let him declare his wealth and everyone else in government should declare. Let this government be known as a government that has zero tolerance on corruption,” he addedSecondly, he urged the President to nurture a culture of work ethic in the country, stating this would also go a long way in combating corruption in the country.Thirdly, he pointed out that the country needs to embrace the use of modern technology, noting that technology would address the food challenges facing the country.Lastly, Dr. Wainaina highlighted that the country needs to cut on imports, stating that Kenya needs to be a producing country not an importing country.The Kenyan DAILY POST."

That is, what they could and should not do depending on the referee designated for the matches.One issue that has arisen is that the Tax Agency has attested that there is no documentation currently in their possession that details any such relationship of consultancy between Negreira and Barcelona."

That is why we propose that they can be dispensed free of charge in educational and social centres.’ Spain decriminalised abortion in 1985. But in 2010, it passed a law that allows women to opt freely for abortion during the first 14 weeks of pregnancy in most cases."

I give advice for free…Supposing you withdrew Raila’s security with this tension in the country, you know 100,000 people can go to Karen to guard him.

But the Indonesian government has stood firm and said Papua will ‘forever remain a legitimate part’ of Indonesia, raising fears that Mehrtens may not be released.It was reported that Mehrtens had landed his plane, with five passengers on board, on a small runway in Paro and was scheduled to pick up 15 construction workers who had been building a health centre in the district after the separatist rebels threatened to kill them.‘Our plan to evacuate the workers angered the rebels, who responded by setting fire to the plane and seizing the pilot,’ said Nduga district chief Namia Gwijangge, who was one of the passengers. ‘We deeply regret this incident.’The rebels released all five passengers because they are indigenous Papuans, rebel spokesperson Sebby Sambom said earlier.Sambom shared videos and photos on Tuesday that showed a group of gunmen, led by Kogoya, setting fire to the plane on the runway.In a viral video, the man was ordered by the rebels to say, ‘Indonesia must recognize Papua is independent.’‘I took him hostage for Papua independence, not for food or drinks,’ Kogoya said in the video with Mehrtens standing next to him. ‘He will be safe with me as long as Indonesia does not use its arms, either from the air or on the ground.’Indonesia’s Coordinating Minister for Political, Security and Legal Affairs Mohammad Mahfud said the government was making every effort to persuade the rebels to release Mehrtens ‘because the priority is the safety of the hostage.’‘Taking civilians hostage for any reason is unacceptable,’ Mahfud said in a video statement late Tuesday. He said persuasion is the best method to ensure hostage safety, but ‘the government does not rule out other efforts.’He emphasised the government’s view that Papua is part of Indonesia. ‘Papua will forever remain a legitimate part of the unitary state of the Republic of Indonesia,’ Mahfud said.New Zealand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said Wednesday in a statement: ‘We are aware of the photos and video circulating but won’t be commenting further at this stage.’Papua police chief Mathius Fakhiri told reporters in Jayapura, the provincial capital, that they are seeking to obtain the pilot’s freedom by involving several community leaders, including tribal and church figures, to build communication and negotiate with the rebels.Meanwhile, the president United Liberation Movement for West Papua (ULMWP), Benny Wenda issued a statement on February 9 that laid out his demands.‘The ULMWP Executive reiterates and reassures the New Zealand government and the world that we are [using] a peaceful, diplomatic approach,’ President Wenda wrote.‘Our roadmap is very clear: we are pursuing the unified West Papuan goal of national liberation peacefully, through diplomatic political mechanisms.’To release Mr. Mehrtens, the rebels are demanding the removal of Indonesian troops from West Papua, a UN investigation into alleged human rights violations, a referendum of independence, and a cancellation of ‘Special Autonomy’.‘The kidnap of a foreign pilot naturally brings West Papua to the attention of international media,’ Wenda continued.‘The international community must help to end the violence in West Papua by forcing Indonesia to come to the table and discuss a referendum, the only path to a peaceful resolution.‘We will peacefully continue our long fight for freedom, until the world finally hears our cry.However, a spokesperson for the Liberation Army has also issued a warning to other countries and areas, including Australia.‘[The West Papuan Liberation Army] considers New Zealand, Australia, Indonesia, America, Europe, all are responsible,’ a statement from the Liberation Army’s secretary, Sebby Sambom, reads.‘The US, Europe, Australia and New Zealand has supported the Indonesian government, trained The Indonesian National Police, supplied weapons to kill us West Papuans from 1963 to today. They must be held accountable.’ See photos"

While this is painful, it is a relief to finally have a clear diagnosis.“FTD is a cruel disease that many of us have never heard of and can strike anyone. For people under 60, FTD is the most common form of dementia, and because getting the diagnosis can take years, FTD is likely much more prevalent than we know.“Today there are no treatments for the disease, a reality that we hope can change in the years ahead. As Bruce’s condition advances, we hope that any media attention can be focused on shining a light on this disease that needs far more awareness and research.“Bruce always believed in using his voice in the world to help others, and to raise awareness about important issues both publicly and privately.“We know in our hearts that ‘ if he could today — he would want to respond by bringing global attention and a connectedness with those who are also dealing with this debilitating disease and how it impacts so many individuals and their families.“Ours is just one family with a loved one who suffers from FTD, and we encourage others facing it to seek out the wealth of information and support available through AFTD (@theaftd, theaftd.org).“And for those of you who have been fortunate enough to not have any personal experience with FTD, we hope that you will take the time to learn about it, and support AFTD’s mission in whatever way you can.“Bruce has always found joy in life ‘ and has helped everyone he knows to do the same. It has meant the world to see that sense of care echoed back to him and to all of us. We have been so moved by the love you have all shared for our dear husband, father, and friend during this difficult time. Your continued compassion, understanding, and respect will enable us to help Bruce live as full a life as possible.”The statement was signed by wife Emma, ex-wife Demi, and his daughters Rumer, Scout, Tallulah, Mabel, and Evelyn.Willis shares Rumer, 34, Scout, 31 and Tallulah, 29, with Moore,60 to whom he was married from 1987 to 2000.

Among the questions, the detectives sought to establish how the three armed men infiltrated the compound despite active CCTV cameras within and outside the premises. Further, detectives wondered how the gang bypassed the 24-hour electric fence to gain access to the compound. Another concern was how the trio managed to bypass the security guards unnoticed. Reports indicated that the robbers broke into the home, and harassed the househelp and Jumwa’s daughters before stealing Ksh1.1 million. Other items stolen included gold jewelry, laptops, three mobile phones and other accessories.According to the police report filed at the Spring Valley Police Station under the OB Number 03/02/2023, the incident reportedly occurred at around 1:45 pm on Wednesday, February 15, while the Public Affairs CS was away on official duty.“The gang of three men, armed with crude weapons, entered the compound by cutting the electric perimeter wall and gained access to the main house through the backdoor, which was not locked,” part of the police report stated.The Kenyan DAILY POST."

She also said she believes the ‘demonisation’ of transgender bodies ultimately led to her attacker carrying out sexual violence.Panelist Kelle Bryan asked what her lowest moment was during those years of ‘coming out’ and feeling ‘ostracised’.  She replied: ‘There was a really difficult time in the book, I was sexually assaulted right at the beginning of my transition.‘I had this encounter because society demonises our bodies so much to the point where men who find us attractive are being fed it is so wrong that they do it in secret and often enact sexual violence on us.‘I was locked in a room for two hours and raped, I was stalked for six hours before, I met him on a night out and then he found where I lived and where I worked and raped me very badly.‘It just sent me on a really dark trajectory because there was no help and socially and culturally things have gotten worse and we are being painted as the people you should be looking out for when really we are all being affected with misogyny and violence against women.’Speaking to The Guardian Munroe recently said: ‘When you look at someone and you know they want to kill you, and they don’t see you as human enough to respect you when you say ‘no, you don’t want to have sex with them’, and [they] rape you anyway, that just kills a part of you.’‘I don’t know how I can unsee that. I still struggle to think of that period because I lost all hope. After that, I started hating myself a lot and entered abusive relationships because I didn’t think I deserved any more.’"

She then appeared to strike him in the head.A Brown County sheriff’s officer quickly sprang into action and tackled Schabusiness to the ground, struggling to keep her down as she tried to squirm out of his grasp.‘Stop,’ the officer kept telling Schabusiness as she tried to kick herself free, and wrapped her foot around a cord connected to his utility belt.Two other sheriff’s deputies could be seen arriving to tackle the 25-year-old, trying to speak to her calmly.A woman supporting Schabusiness also tried to calm the defendant down, according to the Gazette.Together, they were able to get Schabusiness to calm down and sit her up against a door before leading her out.When court finally resumed about 10 minutes after the attack, Jolly informed a judge on the case he planned to file a motion asking to be removed as Schabusiness’ lawyer.Schabusiness is charged with first degree homicide, mutilating a corpse and third-degree sexual assault.The victim’s own mother discovered her son’s severed head in a bucket, covered with a towel, in her home.According to police, Schabusiness admitted to giving oral sex and using a sex toy on her victim after he was dead. She has pleaded not guilty by reason of mental illness or defect.The question of Schabusiness’ fitness to stand trial has been a central issue of her court proceedings since she was arrested last year.An expert hired by the court had testified that she was capable of assisting in her own defense, but an expert hired by the defense raised doubt.If found competent, the trial will proceed as scheduled. But if she is found not competent to stand trial, the case will be put on hold as she receives additional psychiatric treatment.Schabusiness was arrested in Feb. 2022, after Shad Rock Thyrion’s mother found his severed head in a bucket in her basement.Police records show Tara Pakanich, 47, called authorities to her home in Green Bay’s west side shortly after 3am on February 23.She said she was woken by the storm door slamming and the sound of a vehicle driving away. She then noticed that the basement light was on and went to see if her son was there, assuming that it was Schabusiness, with whom Thyrion had spent the day, that she had heard leaving.According to the criminal complaint, which refers to her only by her initials, ‘TP went into the basement and did not see anyone, so she started to walk back up the stairs, and that was when she noticed a bucket next to the bottom of the stairs.Tara Pakanich stated she removed a blanket that was over the bucket, and she discovered the head of her son.Thyrion’s mother told police that Schabusiness had picked her son up around 9.30pm on February 21, which was when she last saw him alive.Pakanich and her boyfriend were out for much of the following day, and she did not hear her son and Schabusiness return, but she believed they had spent the day in the basement as she heard Schabusiness’ voice.Arriving on the scene, Green Bay Police Officer Alex Wanish reported how he had ‘observed the plastic bucket on the floor…[with] a shower/beach towel over the bucket.’The officer ‘lifted the towel and observed a human head inside the bucket.’He also noted ‘what appeared to be dried blood on a nearby mattress.’It didn’t take long for police to catch up to Schabusiness. They found her with blood still on her sweatshirt and sweatpants, scratches on her arms, a cut on her left thumb and what appeared to be blood on her hands.Schabusiness, who has a husband, Warren, and had recently become a mother to a son, Mateo, admitted that she knew Thyrion. The pair were also Facebook friends.She claimed that they had been doing drugs, including smoking methamphetamine, earlier in the day. She said she had also shot herself and Thyrion up with Trazadone, a powerful sedative.Police recovered evidence of drug-taking, including a glass pipe and bag containing light colored powder, from the scene.When told by detectives that police had found Thyrion’s head in a bucket Schabusiness responded, ‘that is pretty f***d up.’ And when asked what had happened in the basement she replied, ‘that is a good question’ and initially claimed to have blacked out.She allegedly went on to tell police that she and Thyrion had been going to have sex and that he had produced two metal chains, one for him and one for her. She said he put his chain around his own neck as strangulation was something they had used during intercourse before.According to the complaint Schabusiness then suddenly blurted out, ‘Damn the head. I can’t believe I left the head though’ before telling officers they were ‘going to have fun trying to find all of the organs as she had dismembered the body.’She told them that most of the body parts were in the basement but that ‘there should be a foot or a leg’ in her minivan.Remaining calm, Schabusiness allegedly told detectives that after Thyrion put the chain around his neck, she just went ‘crazy’ strangling him.She said that she could feel his heart beating, ‘so she kept pulling and choking him harder,’ claiming that he would not die as he just kept ‘rebuilding into muscle.’The woman then told how she sat on top of him, choking him while he lay face down on the bed and how she watched as he coughed up blood and ‘waited for him to die.’At some point, she admitted, she knew that he was dead as his face was purple and blood was coming from his mouth. Still, she told detectives, that she was ‘already this far’ so she did not stop.At one point, the criminal complaint says, Schabusiness recalled in a lower tone of voice, ‘Ya, I liked it’ when referring to choking her victim.Asked what she did once she realized he was dead, Schabusiness stated that she had ‘played’ with Thyrion’s body.The complaint reads, ‘Schabusiness stated she sucked the Victim’s penis, that she had a dildo that she put in the Victim’s mouth and then in the Victim’s a**.’She said that Thyrion had fought back as she strangled him and went on to tell detectives that she had decapitated and dismembered him with knives taken from Thyrion’s mother’s kitchen.She told them they would find the knives she had used in the same black bags as she had put the body parts into. She said she had favored a bread knife because the serrated edge made it more effective for the grizzly task.Thyrion’s penis was found in the same bucket as his head while other body parts were found in a variety of bags in the basement including plastic shopping bags. His upper torso was found in a storage tote along with a carving knife and several internal organs.His legs and other body parts were found in a crockpot box on top of a laundry basket of clothes in the rear passenger seat of her minivan.Schabusiness told detectives that she had planned to take all the body parts with her when she left in her minivan but that she had ‘got lazy’ and was ill-prepared because the murder was random and not planned.Asked if she thought that what she had done was the right thing to do Schabusiness commented that she ‘did it anyway.’Schabusiness remains in custody as hearings into her ability to stand trial continue.She faces life in prison if convicted.See photos and watch the video below"

She also claimed the former One Direction crooner had a fling with co-star Florence Pugh before he ultimately got together with Wilde.‘As parents, it is incredibly upsetting to learn that a former nanny of our two young children would choose to make such false and scurrilous accusations about us publicly,’ the duo said. ‘Her now 18-month-long campaign of harassing us, as well as loved ones, close friends and colleagues, has reached its unfortunate apex.‘We will continue to focus on raising and protecting our children with the sincere hope that she will now choose to leave our family alone.’"

The majority of the 17.5 million votes said yes.‘I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job! After that, I will just run the software & servers teams,’ Musk tweeted after the poll.Forbes analysis ranks Musk as the second-wealthiest person on Earth, just behind French luxury brand magnate Bernard Arnault. Forbes estimates Musk’s wealth at just under $200 billion.Since Musk took full ownership of Twitter on October 27, the platform has undergone a series of rapid changes, including charging $10 for a blue tick."

He was suspended by United and has not appeared or trained with the club since then.Earlier this month, the charges were dropped with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) citing a ‘withdrawal of key witnesses and new material that came to light’, developments that meant there was ‘no longer a realistic prospect of conviction’ They added that they had a ‘duty’ not to proceed with the case in such circumstances. Greenwood denied the charges.With United conducting their own investigation, the men’s senior squad, report The Times, are split over whether or not the former United academy starlet should be allowed to return.The report states that some of the members of the squad harbour concerns about his return, as is reported to be the case with the women’s team, while some possess no objections to Greenwood being welcomed back.United themselves said they will ‘conduct’ their own ‘process before determining the next steps’. Greenwood remains prohibited from training or playing for the club while this process is ongoing. It is reported that it could stretch on for months.Among the women’s squad, who share the Carrington base with the men, opinion is said to be that Greenwood should not be allowed to return. It is reported that some commercial partners also harbour reservations about him being brought back.The player released a statement after the CPS announced their decision, writing: ‘I am relieved that this matter is now over and I would like to thank my family, loved ones and friends for their support. There will be no further comment at this time.’Erik ten Hag, asked about the case of Greenwood in his press conference the day after the charges were dropped, referred people to the statement put out by the club.‘I can’t add anything, I refer to the statement of the club,’ he said.Greenwood first joined United at the age of six and made his debut for the club in 2019, in a victory over French side Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League."

He has not shown any intent to be a fixture in his bastard daughter’s life and somehow, we are still being dragged into the drama they are experiencing.When she gave birth to their daughter, Tiffany Muikamba was quick to run to social media to let us know that she is yet to receive any form of support from Bensoul even though he and his current woman marked the arrival of his daughter.And there is no clearer indication that the baby wasn’t wanted by her father. Yes what he did was moronic, cheating without wearing any form of protection but he never envisioned himself playing house with his paramour as he was still committed to his actual woman. She was nothing but a sidepiece who attempted to baby trap him.I am left wondering whether this girl doesn’t have friends in her life. No, not a mortley crew of cheerleaders and yes-men but actual friends who hold her accountable. If that is a stretch then how about aunties and a mother? Tiffany Muikamba doesn’t strike me as a woman who is intouch with reality and she doesn’t have anyone in her life that keeps her grounded.So what does that result in? A woman who has refused to come to grips with the fact she is never going to be anything more than a dirty little secret Bensoul is upset was exposed.Tiffany Muikamba has refused to accept the truth that her daughter is little more than an inconvenience for her father. But the sooner she listens and realises there is no one coming to save her, the better. Also, please stop telling us about all your frustrations.

We join all their fans and family and friends in wishing them a long, loving marriage. But…The truth is, they will have a lot of pressure on their heads. This has already begun to present itself in the form of scrutiny. You see, Edgar Obare has already begun to unearth certain unsavoury details about their engagement (it has since emerged that they didn’t actually get married) chief of which is the allegation he might be performing bigamy.That means DJ Bones already has a wife and two children by her. Then there is the fact that Kamene Goro has positioned herself as the elder sister of every entitled Nairobi girl.Because she is the official spokeswoman for Baby Gurl™ and we will all be looking to see whether she actually dispenses advice based on what she would herself do or whether it is all just cheap radio fodder. Does she actually intend to be an entitled married woman or does she simply say what sounds good whether or not it can cause real-world damage?Then there is the fact that she herself is someone who needs to be guided and helped so she doesn’t poison the union. What do I mean? Well, simply put, she needs counselling/ therapy.Kamene Goro was married and that marriage failed. Why did it fail? We don’t really know because we have only ever truly heard her side of things and she doesn’t once fess up to how she contributed to her abortive marriage. If DJ Bones isn’t a simp, he needs to call her out on this fact and then demand that she goes for individual counselling before she then joins him for couple’s counselling.She also has that one needling fact about her: she slept with well over 27 men! And why am I bringing this up you ask? Well because any woman who has slept with as many men as she has also has near-irreparable damage to her pair-bonding ability. Long story short? She cannot be happy in the confines of monogamy and marriage.She has her foot in through the door now that she’s engaged. Kamene Goro has managed a feat I for one never thought I would ever see her accomplish -she managed to find the one man in all of Kenya who is willing to marry her and make an honest woman out of her but now it is her behaviour that will see her follow through to the wedded bliss part of it.But there is a lot of work to be done. And most of it is on her side of the court. Kamene Goro needs to put in the work if she doesn’t want to eventually end up as a warning we use for other women.For more thought-provoking opinion pieces, click here.

I hope she didn’t drink her own koolaid.Why does he need to ride her clout? Well, he needed to surf that wave because she was the flavour of the week. She was what everyone was discussing and he figured he needed to revive his career.It truly is a pity he hasn’t put out any music while we were still discussing their relationship. As for Pritty Vishy, she’s back to discussing her ex, Stevo Simple Boy and we have to wonder why… Actually, we don’t. It’s envy.She wants what Stevo Simple Boy is also pretending to be giving his beau. She has never really gotten over her ex and it shows every time she discusses him and we know it.And there is simply no helping her unless she gets into a relationship with a man she feels is truly above Stevo Simple Boy’s status or has more money than he does.

Concrete barriers were placed outside the studios to prevent any attack by a vehicle.""I cannot believe it has come to this,"" said the network's general manager, Mahmood Enayat.""A foreign state has caused such a significant threat to the British public on British soil that we have to move,"" he said.""Let's be clear, this is not just a threat to our TV station, but the British public at large.""Iran International has been one of the most prominent providers of news on the recent wave of anti-government protests in Iran.Protests swept across the country in September following the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who was detained by morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly.In October, the Iranian government announced sanctions against Iran International and BBC News Persian, accusing them of ""incitement of riots"" and ""support of terrorism"" over their coverage of the anti-government protests that have engulfed the country over the past two months.The two UK-based channels are already banned from Iran, but a press freedom watchdog says they are among the main sources of news and information in a country where independent media and journalists are constantly persecuted.In November, Iran's Intelligence Minister, Esmail Khatib, said Iran International had been identified by Tehran as a ""terrorist"" organisation, that all co-operation and links with it would be considered a threat against national security, and that its ""agents"" would be pursued, state news agency Irna reported.He also accused the UK of spreading propaganda against Iran's clerical establishment and warned it would ""pay for its measures to create insecurity""."

I had a group where I was mobilising people to contribute towards the construction of the house and after enough money was raised, I sent all of it to the family. I have evidence,” he said.Ringtone said his WhatsApp group contributed Sh115,000 and the money was spent to build a house for Ilagosa where his body was kept overnight before the burial on Thursday.“The other group was headed by Solomon Mkubwa and Annastacia Mukabwa and another person. They should shade light on how the money was spent,” Ringtone said adding that there was a misunderstanding during the burial where only Sh160,000 was mentioned.Also read: EXCLUSIVE – How gospel artistes failed to give Ilagosa decent sendoffRingtone further alleged that some gospel singers did not trust Ilagosa’s family with the money they had contributed.“I told them to let the family mange the money since it was their son but they wanted to manage everything,” he said.Before Ilagosa’s burial, his fellow musicians allegedly told the family to leave every plan to them since he was one of them.This even after a video emerged of Ilagosa’s brother begging the gospel singers to involve the family in planning the burial.The artistes had also promised to cement Ilagosa’s grave, which did not happen. They also built a mud house whose cost is now being questioned.Asked if it was true gospel singer did not go to the grave site, Ringtone said he was tired of walking and he could not be allowed to drive there yet it was some distance away.“I am sorry that I did not manage but I have done my best in terms of supporting the family. I am among those who contributed the largest amount including paying for his mortuary fees,” he said.Ringtone also alleged that Ilagosa’s family and gospel singers did not agree on several things.Also read: The Voice of Heaven Silenced: Ilagosa Wa Ilagosa’s burial will cost Sh1.5mHowever, a brother of the Sara Zangu hitmaker has said the musician was not given a decent send-off.“I was part of the committee that was planning his burial.

Until now, we have not seen anything,” the brother said.The brother also alleged that Ilagosa’s family had to intervene for his body to be transported in a hearse.“His grave has been done kienyeji. Ilagosa was brought home like someone who had killed. His body was not respected. Our clan has been ashamed. We took a hearse and brought the body home.”The brother further requested gospel singers to respect their traditions.“According to Maragoli culture, Ilagosa was supposed to be given three cows, two to be slaughtered and one given to the uncle. The uncle is crying that he has not been given the cow. They have not slaughtered the cow. The gospel singers really disrespected my brother during the burial.”Also read: Fame has denied me many things in life, ‘Maria’ actress Dorea Chege says"

The lawmaker raised eyebrows this week after hosting leaders from Central, Eastern, Rift Valley and Nairobi in his Kiharu home turf.
Leaders present at the meeting declared him as the most ideal successor to President William Ruto, opening the chapter for what could turn out to be a bruising battle against Gachagua who is also understood to be keen on succeeding the president.
Nyoro’s unstoppable rise enjoys the blessings of his boss, President Ruto who has on numerous occasions expressed a soft spot for the youthful lawmaker who he fondly introduces as “part of our future that we must groom”.

Several MPs have also coalesced around Gachagua who they hold, is the senior-most political figure from the region and best placed to succeed Ruto and champion the region’s interest.

Among those backing Gachagua are rebel Jubilee lawmakers Kanini Kega and Sabina Chege who broke ranks with retired President Uhuru Kenyatta.
“As we speak, no other leader holds higher political authority than Mr Gachagua in the Mt Kenya region. He is the reigning leader of the Mountain.” Kega said when he declared that he will work with the Kenya Kwanza administration.
Commenting on the reports of rivalry, Nyoro downplayed the same, noting that he is a subordinate to the president and his deputy, adding that it is not yet time for politics.
“Politics has a way of going overboard...What remains is that the President of Kenya is Dr Ruto, deputised by Mr Gachagua. All the others in the government are their subordinates…We have a contract with the people” Nyoro explained.
Tell-tale signs that all was not well in the wheelbarrow party surfaced in the Kandara by-election when a section of UDA politicians lashed out at Water CS Alice Wahome while in the company of party secretary general, Veronicah Maina, accusing the CS of supporting a rival candidate in the contest."

The entrepreneurs have the opportunity to negotiate a deal with one or more of the sharks who may offer to invest in their business in exchange for equity.
Nyamumbo appeared on the show seeking $350,000 (Sh44 million) for 5% of her company Kahawa 1893.
Kahawa 1893 founder Margaret Nyamumbo pitching her business on Shark Tank show
The coffee company, which sources directly from women farmers in Africa, is hoping to revolutionize the coffee industry by compensating farmers in a new way.
Nyamumbo, who grew up on her grandfather's coffee farm in Kenya, is passionate about sharing the delicious coffee produced by Kenyan farmers.
She noted that 90% of the labour and coffee comes from women, who are often not compensated because they do not own the land.

Nyamumbo disclosed that the firm not only sources coffee directly from women farmers in Africa but also allows customers to tip the farmers.
Kahawa 1893 then matches the tips, allowing customers to directly impact the lives of the farmers who produce their coffee.
The Sharks were intrigued by a sample of Nyamumbo's coffee before proceeding to ask questions about the business.
“Oh that’s a good coffee,” remarked Robert Herjavec whose estimated wealth is $200 million (Sh25 billion).
“I am a tea girl but that’s a good cup of coffee,” added Emma Grede who is said to be worth $360 million (Sh45 million).
Emma Grede then made an offer to invest the $350,000 (Sh44 million) in Nyamumbo's business for an 8% stake, which was accepted by the Kenyan-born entrepreneur.
Nyamumbo has a personal connection to the coffee industry. Her grandfather was a driver for the colonial government who managed to start his own coffee farm with some seedlings.
After studying abroad in the USA, Nyamumbo returned home with a vision to bring Kenyan coffee to the world in a way that benefits women farmers the most.
With her company, Kahawa 1893, she is working towards empowering women coffee farmers by sourcing directly from them and allowing customers to tip and provide additional compensation for their hard work.

""In case non-fungible token (NFT) decides that they want to buy the dance, how will I prove it's mine? You just need to have the certificate to prove that you created the choreography,"" explained Moya.
His explanation has come days after Kenyans asked him to stop using People's music in his videos since they were also copyrighted.

Chameleone: ""You asked a good question; Saha, does he sing, speak Kiswahili?""
Entertainer: ""I've not heard that he released any song in Kiswahili.""
Chameleone: ""So, what did he add to Valu Valu?... Very simple... You may have been around when I was recording the song... But being around as they construct a house, it's not you who built it... You know! Saha doesn't speak Kiswahili, so what did he add? If he wrote Valu Valu, let him write another one like that... Doesn't he want to sing a song like that?""
Saha's conversation with Entertainer went like this:
Entertainer said: ""I'm shocked, the man wrote Valu Valu,... the man wrote Badilisha... I'm surprised Saha writes music for people, and he is not one of those that blows his own trumpet... He doesn't go around bragging about his work.""
Saha chimed in: ""Calvin, what you need to know is that there are smart people in the industry... One day you ask artistes when they come to your show, one by one; Chameloene, has Saha ever written for you a song? Kenzo, has Saha ever written for you a song?... there are artistes who know that that man is smart.”
He added: ""What I'm good at is singing, the rest I can learn. You can criticise my English command, but in music, I don't make mistakes... I'm always in a straight line because I know how to sing.”
He went on: ""Sometimes I also listen to music by other singers, and I'm like, that one is smart. You just give people time. They will surprise you and make you run mad... music needs time... I've written songs for many artistes.""
It should be recalled Chameleone mentored Saha under his record label, Leone Island, when he was an upcoming artiste."

How many glasses of water do you consume every day?How much is enough water? A human being needs to drink enough water daily and here are reasons why you should take eight glasses of water on a daily basis.

Enough water maintains your skin
Experts say taking eight glasses of water a day helps in brightening one's skin and even brightens it up. enough water promotes collagen production in the body.
You should note that water can't reduce the effects of aging.
Enough water reduces headaches

Saliva production
A human's body relies on enough water uptake to produce saliva in the mouth. Reducing the quantity of water consumption leads to a drop in saliva production.

These are some of the big dreams that have to be realised in the two-day vacation.
Perhaps our needs have outgrown the weekend. That is okay. Here are some tips to tailor your weekend to fit you.
Manage your expectations and attitude
Set realistic goals. If you bombard yourself with plans and activities you reduce your chances of getting satisfaction and meaning from any of them.
Prioritise from the most valuable and work your way down as the day winds down.
Keep a positive attitude. Avoid setting your plans with a negative tone. For example, instead of saying ""I don't want anything to disturb me this weekend"" say ""I'm going to enjoy some alone time.""
This way your mood will not be ruined if people inevitably interrupt you. You will be in a better mood to handle disturbances and plan how to respond.
Don't oversleep
After running around for five days on stress hormones, if you oversleep your body will crash badly.
Weekends are not time to compensate for poor sleep from the work week. You will wake up tired, with a headache, and generally in a bad mood.
Sleep is part of rest but not all of it. Get your full eight hours and do other restful or energising activities.
Spread out sleep and rest through the week so you don't feel the need to squeeze all your sleep into the weekend.
Weekend mindset
Wanting more from your weekend might be a sign that your expectations or beliefs about it are not being met.
However, those expectations and beliefs might be harmful and incompatible with you or your lifestyle at the moment.
You might also need to get a better mindset about it.
A study published in the Harvard Business Review in 2019 using 400 employees as participants, found that those who treated it as a holiday, rather than a standard weekend, enjoyed it more.
The difference was not in activities or expenditure, it was the mindset that set the mood and brought more meaning and happiness.
Plan in advance
You are more likely to honour planned activities than spontaneous ones.
Planned activities are also given more thought and are less likely to be thrown out for something else.
Even if you trust your willpower to think up something and do it, plan it ahead for formality.
You will also be able to allocate time and see that you have more time than you might think.
The bonus is you have something to look forward to.
Room for spontaneity
Leave space to be spontaneous in your routine and planned activities.
You will feel more relaxed about it. It also adds variety which is important to differentiate it from your grind.
Don't fall for Sunday night blues
Sunday night blues is that feeling of dread and apprehension over the end of the weekend.
Your Sunday may start great but by the afternoon, you want to rewind the clock.
Don't give in to this feeling because it wounds you twofold. The anxiety is unnecessary because the week will always come, better to figure out how to embrace it.
Secondly, all the joy from your weekend is stolen as your mind focuses on the negative feelings around Monday."

According to a local media house, the embattled legislator left the DCI offices yesterday at around 6:15 pm after being questioned for the second day in a row.
Pkosing's lawyer Danstan Omari has labeled his client as a clean man and that the legislator denied claims of being involved in the business of buying and selling cattle.
“We were told to come back and answer to issues of the commercialization of bandits, that the cows are being stolen are normally handed over to Mheshimiwa so he should respond to money laundering.

“We have come and the same questions have been put to Mheshimiwa, he has responded that all his life, he has never been in the business of selling or buying cattle,"" said Omari.
Why Pkosing was arrested
Pokot South MP David Pkosing was detained on February 16, 20223, by the DCI for questioning in regard to aiding bandits in West Pokot.
It all started when the lawmaker posted a bond for seven boys who he cited to be innocent although they had been arrested on banditry claims.
Pkosing stated that he did not know the boys and that he was shocked that he was arrested for helping the boys.
“I am shocked that I am being arrested for posting bond for young boys labelled as criminals. I even don’t know their names, they’re innocent boys. I have even never met them. What I know is that they’re innocent boys, and that is why the court had seen it fit to release them on bond,” he said.
It has been reported that the DCI will contact Pkosing on Monday, February 20, 2023, in case he will be needed for more questioning."

Follow TUKO.co.ke on Twitter!For example, a younger daughter's marital rituals like dowry payment popularly known as Nyombo, are conducted outside the homestead if an elder sister has not gone through t process.According to Argwings Acholla, the culture does not allow a younger daughter in a home to have her dowry negotiation and payment activities take place in her father’s homestead if her elder sister’s dowry has not been paid.He said that according to the community’s customs, in case a younger sister’s bride price is paid before her elder sister’s the latter dies.Acholla told TUKO.co.ke that in case a younger daughter's bride price is due ready to be paid before her elder sister the dowry payment is either delivered to her brothers’ or uncles’ homes, not her father’s homestead.Birth, marriage and death are life stages that many, if not all living beings are expected to go through and customs surrounding them are strictly followed lest the spirits are angered and visit with wrath.Among the Luo, a girl who has attained the age to get married legally is referred to as Migogo.He said that in case a Migogo dies before she gets married she is not supposed to be mourned in her father’s compound.According to the elder, if such a woman dies within her father’s homestead, she is taken out of the compound through a back gate.In some occasions, they are taken for burial by any well-wisher who has completed the marriage rites. The person will be referred to as the late woman’s husband,” Acholla expounded.He observed that male well-wishers who fulfill these rites do so to appease the deceased.Customs also dictate that that a deceased Migogo can be given to a man as wife.The man then is supposed to undertake all ritual activities to formalise the union before burying her.According to the elder, if the eldest daughter’s marital rites are fulfilled and bride price paid, even in her death, her younger siblings are freed from curses and can undergo marriage processes in their parents’ homes.Leonorah Auma who is in her late 60s narrated how tough it was for her to lose her daughter before the latter got married and had to take her through the customs.She is however relieved that the decision to bury the daughter at her aunt's place would strengthen the two families' ties.According to Auma being that her first daughter was buried by the family at least known to her gives her peace and so she hopes her daughters soul is peaceful as well.PAY ATTENTION: Click “See First” under the “Following” tab to see TUKO News on your News Feed"

Yet he did.He first shoved aside two possible contenders for the ODM ticket; Sam Ongeri and former Kisii woman representative Janet Ongera.Then he defied the machinations of his predecessor James Ongwae who was not keen to be succeeded by him.Eventually, at the ballot, he successfully took on veterans Chris Obure and Ezekiel Machogu.Simba Arati seemed to have picked and ran a campaign similar to that of President William Ruto.Both invested heavily in terms of money and time in their campaign and seemed aware that power is never given but taken. They scoured every inch day in and day out.On Friday, February 17, Raila held a rally in Kisii despite opposition from a section of leaders from the region.During a stopover in Keroka, the ODM leader slammed Ongwae for leading a group of leaders who warned him against having a rally in Kisii.Terming the group traitors, Raila said it was absurd being threatened by people he considers to have helped politically.Raila added that he sought Arati's permission to tour the region and was more than willing to welcome him.PAY ATTENTION: Click “See First” under the “Following” tab to see TUKO News on your News Feed"

However, finding a suitable contribution request message might be difficult even for the most confident people. Asking for money as a gift is traditionally considered taboo but has recently become accepted. But how do you solicit contributions on your big day without offending anyone? And what is the most creative wedding contribution request you can make?Getting people to contribute to your wedding may take more work. Due to the current economic climate, most people hesitate to make unneeded contributions. So, if you're looking for wedding contribution requests, you'll have to think outside the box. But which method is best for getting people to contribute financially to your wedding ceremony? Are there any novel ways to solicit wedding contributions?A wedding gift money contribution is among the best ways to receive donations for your big day. Even after the ceremony, you can still recoup some of your investment. Most couples, however, struggle to say that they prefer cash gifts or donations for their reception or honeymoon. Though uncomfortable, being direct can save you a lot of time, and your guests will know your preference.But how should you go about getting a wedding contribution request? Of course, by being inventive. Asking people for money may irritate them, so tread carefully on this subject. But luckily for you, there are tried-and-true methods for soliciting wedding contributions.Making your preferences known to close friends and family members can save you a lot of time and make your wedding planning easier. You can rely on your family and friends to spread the word about your preference for cash as a gift over other items. Sharing your intentions with your inner circle, wedding, and bridal party allows them to inform your other friends about your preferred wedding gift.Another creative way to solicit wedding contributions is to inform your friends and family about your plans for the funds. You may desire to save for the perfect dream home or contribute to the best honeymoon as newlyweds. They can help you save for your desired goal instead of giving you cash. Including your dreams and desires in a personal story is another creative way to express them.How do you ask for contributions for a wedding? The best way to ask for contributions for a wedding is through a wishing well at the reception.The wedding wishing-well card is a one-of-a-kind card that comes with your wedding invitation set and contains information about your wedding plans. Though traditionally considered impolite for a bride and groom to express their gift preferences, times are rapidly changing.Using a wishing-well card to tell your guests what to bring you is a fantastic idea. These cards may contain specific information, such as the locations of gift registry shops, gift suggestions, travel fund details, or donation charities. They can have one or both sides printed.Addressing your preferred wedding gift on the invitation letter is one method with a high yield. However, it may appear direct or rude to some of your guests, so tread carefully by being creative. Instead of asking for money upfront, you can disguise it as a contribution to your new home as newlyweds. This is not for the faint of heart; you must phrase your preference carefully to avoid sounding arrogant.A gift registry is a list of preferred gift items curated by the intended recipients of the gifts for a specific occasion or event. Some gift registry services allow you to create a gifting fund, where guests can contribute money to a particular purchase that the couple is planning.

Not really. Some people are shy and don't have excellent conversation skills. And for many people, sending the first message to a crush is nerve-wracking – you don't know if they will like you and respond, ignore you, or even reject you. But if you have tips on how to start a conversation with a crush on WhatsApp, things will fall into place.How can you start a conversation with your crush through text on WhatsApp and impress them? Plenty of tips and tricks can help you start talking to someone you are smitten with. However, you should remember one thing; be yourself and have fun.Speaking to your crush can sometimes bring butterflies. As much as you may be the confident and talkative individual, you can end up blank with nothing to say when a crush is involved. Here are tips to keep the conversation flowing.WhatsApp is unlike most other social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook, where you can post plenty of pictures to impress your crush. However, you can still impress and make them notice you through your profile picture.Before sending the first text, ensure your profile picture is perfect. For example, a picture of yourself, well-groomed, looking your best, and doing something fun is a sure way to get noticed. Besides the profile picture, you can impress your crush on WhatsApp with an interesting 'About' caption and status updates.Knowing something about your crush before you start chatting with them can help the conversation flow easily. Therefore, before sending the first text, do some research on them. Start by going through their WhatsApp profile and looking at their profile picture, About, and status. You can also look them up on other social media sites like Instagram, Facebook, and Tik Tok.The information you uncover about your crush by looking her up can help you start talking to them easily. For example, you can compliment their profile picture, or ask about something they are doing in the picture, say playing the guitar. You can also comment on their status, which is a great way to start a conversation on WhatsApp.Questions are good conversation starters and help you easily navigate the dreaded first message. However, your question has to be unique to increase your chances of getting a reply and impress your crush. For example, a simple ""hi?"" is generic and will not likely get you far in your conversation.Instead, it would help if you asked them something interesting, for example, an activity they are into, an event they attended, and an opinion about an exciting topic. However, when asking questions, you should be careful not to pry into issues that are too personal for your crush. It is also a good idea not to come off as if you are interrogating or interviewing them.One of the best tips to keep the conversation flowing with your crush over WhatsApp is to talk about exciting things, especially ones you have in common. This way, both of you are invested in the conversation and can have fun, making it much easier to impress them.Researching your crush beforehand will be handy at this point, as you can easily find out what you have in common. For example, when going through their WhatsApp profile or other social media accounts, you can notice your shared love of music, movies, cooking, and adventure activities. All of these are great topics to talk about with your crush.Are you having trouble figuring out what to talk to with your crush on WhatsApp? How about sending them a meme? Memes are an excellent way to start a conversation, and they can easily help you get noticed by your crush.In addition, they are great for making them laugh, which can further impress them. However, when choosing a meme to send to someone you like, you should be careful not to pick something offensive which will put them off instead of making them like you.How can you chat with your girl crush on WhatsApp and impress them? Being funny and goofy is one of the top ways. While deep conversations are okay for getting to know each other, being funny, witty, and goofy can brighten your crush’s day and make them laugh, earning you some cool points.On top of being funny, you can also tease and flirt with your crush, which can help make them like you more. However, you must be careful not to send them offensive and insensitive jokes or come off as creepy when flirting.Complimenting your crush is another excellent way to start a conversation with them on WhatsApp. Compliments will make them feel good, noticed, and appreciated and can even make them smile. Therefore, they are one of the top ways to impress your crush and make them like you more.One thing to note is that compliments are not limited to girls only – everyone loves them. Therefore, they are a great way to start a WhatsApp conversation with a guy and make him notice you.When talking to your crush on WhatsApp, there are several things to avoid if you want to impress them. One of these big ""NOs"" is sending them too many text messages, especially multiple texts at a go, or if they have not replied immediately. Such behaviour can be annoying and can even appear controlling or creepy.Instead, allow your crush time to respond and follow their cues. For example, if they respond immediately, it's a good sign that they are interested, and you can do the same. However, if they take time to respond, it could mean they are busy with something else, and you should give them time to get back to you.Kindness can go a long way in impressing someone you like. Therefore, one of the top tips when looking to start a conversation with your crush the first time is to be kind and considerate. Don't say anything mean and rude.It would help if you also were thoughtful about when you are texting them. For example, too late at night or during the day when working might not be the best of times.Lastly, one of the top things to text your crush on WhatsApp is to ask them to hang out. If you've already met and they gave you their number, you can ask them to hang out immediately. For example, a movie, coffee, concert, or asking them to a party. However, if you don't know each other well, you can start a get-to-know-each-other conversation and then ask them out if you click.Knowing how to start a conversation with a crush on WhatsApp can seem like a monumental task. It can be especially overwhelming if you are shy or always nervous about texting someone you like. However, with the tips above, you can get the conversation flowing, get to know more about your crush, and impress them.Tuko.co.ke shared an article about nice things to say to your girlfriend or wife. Showering your significant other with compliments is one of the things you can do to make her happy. This will also come in handy in strengthening your bond since she will feel more loved and appreciated.There is no standard way of showing appreciation and affection to your partner because everyone is different. Therefore, it is up to you to know what makes your wife or girlfriend happy and implement it. However, sayings nice things will go a long way."

Others were surprised by how KDF helicopter remained stationery on air with soldiers alighting it using ropes.However, the operation's location and time was not immediately established.Fast-roping techniqueFast-roping, also known as Fast Rope Insertion Extraction system, is a technique used by KDF soldiers to descend from a chopper using a thick rope.The technique is used to deploy KDF troops where choppers cannot touch down. The tactic is synonymous with KDF during special operations.When executing the technique, KDF soldier holds onto the rope with gloved hands and feet while sliding down it. Several soldiers can slide down the rope simultaneously.Before a pilot gives a go ahead; usually a sandbag is placed at the ed of the rope to hold it on the ground. The sandbag also keeps the rope from getting tangled and endangering the troops descending from the chopper. Fast-roping takes 30 seconds from a chopper to the ground.How Chopper Remains Stationary on airOn the video, air force chopper remained stationary on air allowing KDF soldiers to disembark. It was several feets above the ground with the propellers moving.According to aviation experts, air force helicopter remainined stationery by propelling a large mass of air down through the main rotor."" Some of the air is recirculated near the tips of the blades, curling up from the bottom of the rotor disk and rejoining the air entering the rotor from the top,"" Federal Aviation Administration Helicopter Flying Handbook read in part.The phenomenon is also referred to as tip vortices. According to Federal Aviation Administration, in vortex ring state, most of the power developed by the engine is wasted in circulating the air in a doughnut pattern around the rotor.""A helicopter remains stationary by balancing the external forces. There are no horizontal forces, as the helicopter is not moving left or right, so there is no drag or horizontal thrust,"" How Things Work, an aviation handbook, further explained the phenomenon.""The blades generate a vertical lift, and when this is exactly balanced with the force of gravity, the helicopter remains stationary,"" the handbook explained."

However, Kenyans quickly pointed out that the car rims on his SUV were 'fake' and may have resulted in the accident.Others questioned why he used 'substandard' car parts on the beloved SUV while pinpointing that such rims were sold in a popular area in the CBD.Meanwhile, in a subsequent post, Muchiri shared frequently asked questions by Kenyans where he disclosed that he was driving at a speed of 100 kilometers per hour.He dismissed claims that the rims were from China, noting that those were just allegations from online users. ""I am equally clueless. I have driven vehicles for 18 years and have never experienced such an accident.  I was going to work,"" he stated, answering what caused the accident.However, speaking to Kenyans.co.ke on Saturday, February 18, several car experts noted that the car rims were not fake as insinuated. Still, they were not the original rims of the vehicle.""Original rims do not break that easily. They may bend if the driver gets into an accident, and in rare instances, they may break,"" the mechanic, at a petrol station in Westlands, stated. He added that it all depended on the driver, where he was driving, the speed, and how he was driving. The expert pointed fingers at reckless drivers who put themselves and pedestrians at risk.On why motorists prefer to change rims for the new flashy ones, another expert noted that they are more appealing to the eye and even add value to the car when one intends to sell.""They are also not cheaper than the original rims. People just prefer them for their appearance,"" he added.According to Alasiri Motors, changes on the car amplify the car's value and boost the motorist's premiums. ""Any modification or alteration on a vehicle that would otherwise make it function differently from manufacturer's specifications will or may lead to a claim not being honoured by the insurance company,"" the company stated.In addition, Alasiri Motors urged motorists seeking to modify their car to inform their insurer to work on a way forward."

""I would like to request local leaders and elders to cooperate with our police officers in order to arrest the terror suspects who are among you,"" Kindiki pleaded with Mandera elders. The United States of America, on February 9, 2023, issued what it termed as a 'high level' terror alert to Kenyans and its citizens living in the country. America warned its citizens that terrorists were targeting high-traffic areas frequented by foreigners and tourists in Nairobi. ""Locations frequented by U.S. citizens and other foreigners and tourists in Nairobi and elsewhere in Kenya continue to be attractive targets to terrorists planning to conduct potentially imminent attacks,"" the US Embassy in Kenya stated. The US Embassy in Nairobi warned that the terrorist groups could attack with little or no warning, especially targeting hotels, embassies, restaurants, malls and markets.Americans claimed that the terrorists were also targeting schools, police stations, places of worship, and other places frequented by foreigners and tourists.  The UK High Commission also issued a security alert to its citizens. On February 8, the Commission cautioned of a possible terror threat in Kenya. "

This is because it has the largest share of Grade A commercial office space compared to other competing nodes such as Upperhill, Kilimani and Mombasa Road""In 2022, Grade A offices experienced increased demand from ICT-oriented enterprises as well as non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and multinational corporations (MNCs). This is in tandem with Kenya Vision 2030 which aims to leverage technological developments,"" read the report in part.Property developers in the commercial office industry were, therefore, advised to incorporate more spaces in their designs to attract multinational companies.""Compared to other office sizes, tenants have registered a preference for office space with net lettable areas of between 3,001 square feet and 4,000 square feet,"" read the report in part.On the other hand, key infrastructural developments such as roads in Westands made it attractive to investors as they could easily access their offices and other key facilities in the capital.Some of the projects include the Nairobi Expressway which was launched by former President Uhuru Kenyatta in July 2022. The projects aimed to reduce the duration taken by road users travelling to various destinations such as the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) and Mombasa Road given the traffic menace witnessed on other roads.On the other hand, a number of retail shops opened their outlets in the estate, making it easier for the companies and employees to access key household and basic necessities.""In H2 2022, the major malls to have opened in time for the festive season were Broadwalk, a mixed-use development along Ojijo Road in Westlands, and Greenwood Mall in Meru,"" read the report in part.Apart from office spaces, Westlands also became lucrative for companies in the tourism sector with the JW Marriot hotel set to up at the Global Trade Center (GTC).'Global luxurious hotel leader, JW Marriot, is expected to launch its iconic destination in Westlands, on the GTC in Q4 2023. GTC is by far the tallest skyscraper in East Africa and JW Marriot will complete the work, live, shop and recreate design concept of modern urban communities,"" the report noted."

""The county needs to embed public space in Nairobi’s urban planning and further allocate resources for the creation of new public spaces as well as protection, management, and maintenance of existing spaces. In addition, urban planning tools, such as land
regeneration and urban renewal, must be used to create more public spaces,"" it added.""A land value index should also be developed to compensate the county for mandatory acquisition of land for government projects and investments and land value tax,"" it further recommended.Due to booming developments in suburb estates such as Westland, Loresho and Karen, KIPPRA advised the county to develop frameworks to harmonise development policies.According to KIPPRA, the policies would help President William Ruto's administration and Sakaja address the issue of squatters, land grabbing and further solve traffic jam which they argued was leading to cases of unemployment."

The ferry originally built in Germany in 2008 will be repaired in Kenya at the cost of Ksh400 million (Tsh7.5 billion). “In Tanzania, the certificate of shipbuilding is issued by the Contractors’ Registration Board (CRB).In compliance of Clause 26.7 (vi) of the ITT, the appellant submitted certificate issued by CRB, which certifies it has been registered as specialist contract, class one, local category in the field of marine structures,"" Tanzanian authority was quoted by local press.  The deal was reached after the Kenyan company agreed to review the repair cost downwards from Ksh430 million to Ksh4 million. Repair of MV Magogoni was put on hold, and the tender was canceled by Tanzanian Public Procurement Appeals Authority (PPAA) in 2022 after disagreements about the contract terms. Mama Samia Suluhu-led government then ordered a fresh evaluation of the tenders and made appropriate adjustments that gave authorities confidence in working with the Kenyan company. The trade between Kenya and Tanzania stood at around Ksh124 billion ($1.5 billion) by December 2022, as was strongly supported by imports from both countries. “Bilateral talks between Kenya and Tanzania initiated by the two leaders have been the catalyst behind the improved trade figures across the border,” the Ministry of National Treasury stated in 2022. Kenyans mostly import cereals, wood and vegetables from their neighbours, while Tanzania's major imports include soap, coated flat-rolled iron, packaged medicaments, technologies and machinery. "

As far as journalism is concerned, Ayub's desire to work in a media company began in the early stages of his life and only grew bigger and brighter when he left Wajir for Nairobi to pursue the same goal. ""A passion endured from the onset when I was in Primary School. I come from a family where my 85-year-old grandfather has been tuning in to listen to BBC World Service,"" Abdikadir recalled.At Mount Kenya University where he pursued his Bachelor's degree in communication and journalism, Ayub always took a front-row seat to learn and sharpen his journalistic skills. ""I was a self-sponsored student and that meant that my goals were different since I had to face financial struggles to pay fees. ""I had a side hustle which ensured that I got money to take care of my financial needs, especially during the holidays. One person who is now a Cabinet Secretary (name withheld) was very instrumental in helping me accomplish my studies,"" Ayuba explained. His determination would later earn him an internship opportunity at Ebru TV and later at K24 TV where he truly found a place to exercise his craft. However, before securing his place in scribal templates of Kenyan Journalism, Ayub went through it all, and like a bar of gold going through the refineries, the man from Wajir acquired complex experiences that he was willing to share. ""I look back at that journey and appreciate every little thing that I did as part of my passion for journalism. I'm very proud of the journey despite our divert options in life,"" Ayub noted. Ayub secured a volunteer position which later metamorphosed into an internship programme while he was in his last semester at the university. According to Ayub, life was not easy at all for the young journalist who had to forego many luxuries in life just to stay at the media house.Ayub's sacrifices did not go unnoticed as managers easily recognised his contribution and promoted him to host a morning show while still serving as an intern. ""I worked for nine months as part of my internship course and out of my own personal volition, I decided to extend that volunteership for me to gain more experience,"" Ayub recounted. Ayub asked young budding journalists to consider making sacrifices when they are pursuing their dream jobs since it's out of the small things that bigger things come. His heroic code-breaking efforts during the August 2022 General Election won him a number of fans, especially, when he tactfully hard-pressed election officials to answer the all-importation questions, just a month before the much-contested General Election.The journalist's perfectly nestled contributions to the 2022 Presidential Debate later earned him a vantage place at Kenya's most-watched television station, Citizen TV.""I know talent when I see one. I know professionalism when I spot it. I appreciate the depth and research in journalism. Here is another great one of our nation working towards the top. He will get there. Kudos,"" former Chief Administrative Secretary David Osiany praised him after the interview. He joined Citizen TV on August 5, 2022, and remained on the mission since then - giving his very best to an audience he cherishes most."

However, given that several Kenyans lack information about cars, scrupulous dealers may lie to them regarding the car's age - when the vehicle was manufactured.Nonetheless, there are ways to check the manufacture date, as detailed below;Car Door Jab StickerAll vehicles have a sticker placed on the door that details various components of a car, such as the weight and, most importantly, the year of manufacture.Most vehicle manufacturers also include the month the car was manufactured.If the sticker is worn out, one can look at the registration papers of the vehicles, as the details are often included in the importation documents.However, with the challenge of wear and rear,  some manufacturers have opted to make the sticker metallic.Other methodsNewly imported vehicles also have a 17-digit number on the windscreen, popularly known as the VIN. Most vehicles have the numbers on the bottom left side.Using a VIN decoder tool on social media, one can get the date the vehicle was manufactured. This only applies to cars whose windscreens have not been replaced.Other people also check the engine oil. While the method does not give the exact year's date, one can know whether the car had been used over time.Why is it important to check the date;Checking the manufacture date helps motorists get the right spare parts for the vehicle if they need repairs. Cars may be similar, but manufacturers often change elements of the vehicle.In most cases, people buy spare parts that do not fit."

Gachagua emphasised that the police commander should have protected the victims and their property instead of facilitating the demolitions.The tough-talking second-in-command faulted the commander for proceeding to execute an operation without involving the county security committee and intelligence service. Further, the DP noted that he had instructed the Inspector General of Police, Japhet Koome, to take disciplinary action against the commander. “I saw what happened here, and I almost shed tears. How can you offer protection for people destroying public property armed with guns meant to protect the people?The commander has been recalled, and action will be taken. I have told the IG that the people have to be compensated,"" DP Gachagua noted during his visit to the scene. Gachagua distributed relief food to the victims, who had been left without a shelter since the demolitions on Thursday, February 16. He also offered iron sheets to help the victims erect new houses.

Earlier in the week, area Member of Parliament Paul Chebor stated that he was leading in seeking a consensus between the private investor and the people affected.On Thursday, February 16, reports about a reorganisation of the security structure in Nakuru County surfaced, with sources indicating that a recently assigned commander to the area had been recalled. When reached out for a comment, Police Spokesperson Resila Atieno was reluctant to comment on the reports noting that it was a ""Human Resource"" function within the National Police Service. "

When he came to the newsroom on his routine visits, I nervously whispered to him, fingers crossed,” Latiff revealed.Kirubi gave the green light on Eric’s idea but on condition that KTN writes to him, acknowledging that Capital FM remained the primary employer. That is how the journalist ended up working for two media houses simultaneously.When the Mombasa Road-based media house launched Spice FM in 2019, he was named as one of the hosts of the Situation Room - a popular conversational show focusing on political and current affairs.Latiff has become one of the most sought-after journalists in the media industry owing to his versatility, cutting across TV, radio, print and digital.Laura WalubengoWalubengo worked at Capital FM as a presenter before she left for South African firm MultiChoice in 2014, as DStv's Lead Digital Communications Specialist East Africa.She later she returned to Capital FM in 2017.

I grew so much and so quickly. My outlook, my ideas, my thought process, my dreams, the possibilities; everything just grew.""It was so scary leaving Capital FM after 12.5yrs, and it wasn’t an active move but rather a door opening, and I couldn’t peep - I was either in or out. Can’t wait to see what tomorrow holds. Even today! 6 days to 39,” she revealed.James SmartHe worked at KBC for eight months, then switched to Capital FM before joining Nation Media Group's NTV.Smart later joined KTN as a news anchor and host.After some time at KTN he quit in 2017 to go into private business.

Ali announced his exit from the station during the last edition of his Nuru ya Lugha morning show. In addition, the presenter published a farewell message in his column in The Nairobian.Mixed reactions defined the moment as the presenter bid farewell to his colleagues at the Swahili language station.  In his message, Kauleni reflected on his stint at the Standard Media Group spanning over a decade in different outlets owned by the media house. He noted that his exit was a testament to the fact that change is inevitable in life and that time was ripe for him to make a switch.  ""For close to 13 years, I have been hosting this programme but it is now time to say goodbye,"" Kauleni noted as he signed out from Radio Maisha's Saturday morning show. ""Life is about change just like birth, marrying and dying. Life is like celebrations or tears of joy. I bid farewell to you today,"" he stated. Regarding his next move after leaving Radio Maisha, Kauleni noted that he would issue an update on his social media handles to inform the fans about his new landing. Kauleni was known for his versatility and as one of the few established multimedia journalists.

The company announced a mass restructuring that was projected to declare several positions redundant. "

Ruto was reported to have urged Kega, the East African Legislative Assembly (EALA) MP, and rebel Jubilee lawmakers to convince Uhuru to recognise the current administration. Uhuru was also allegedly pressured to switch allegiance from former Prime Minister, Raila Odinga. Apart from taking Jubilee Party by installing new leaders and suspending those aligned to Raila's Azimio la Umoja, Ruto's administration was accused of using the Ksh700 million retirement perk rewarded to Uhuru, to attempt to convince him to exit politics. Former Cheragany MP, Joshua Kutuny, alluded to a plan to convene a meeting with Uhuru to charter a way forward. ""Within the same period, we hope that our party leader (Uhuru Kenyatta) will reach out so that we explain to him why we want to exit.""We have been frustrated because our members have been denied some positions in Parliament, and that is what has engineered all these, ""Joshua Kutuny told Nation on Friday February 17, arguing that confusion within the party was the sole reason of the rise of splinter groups. Political Parties Tribunal, however, offered Uhuru an upper hand in the battle to control Jubilee, after it suspended the Office of the Registrar of Political Parties directive, which had acknowledged the suspension of Jeremiah Kioni and David Murathe as secretary general and vice chairman, respectively. The two were replaced with Kanini Kega and Aden Keynan. ORPP, led by Anne Nderitu, had also ratified Kanini Kega-led faction's plan to exit Azimio La Umoja but urged them to solve their squabbles internally.Political analyst Andati stated that reaching out to Uhuru would flop as the head of state already pledged his loyalty to former Prime Minister Raila Odinga during the late Education Cabinet Secretary George Omore Magoha's burial.However, he noted that the legislators would be compelled to proceed with their plan to exiting Azimio despite Uhuru's stance.""The MPs who met Ruto at State House already made their minds. Even if Uhuru remains hesitant, they will still battle to leave Azimio,"" he told Kenyans.co.ke.""Another strategy would be challenging the Political Tribunal's decision  decision because Ruto is determined to take back Jubilee,"" Andati explained. According to insiders, a section of Jubilee MPs are also silently pushing Ruto to honour his State House pledge and reach out to Jubilee Party leader before they exit Azimio.""We must build a bigger and better team that will work together to effectively prosecute the agenda of the people of Kenya. We cannot move our country forward by leaving others behind,"" Ruto stated after meeting Jubilee rebel MPs at State House meeting.Despite his security also being scaled down and the wrangle within Jubilee intensifying, Uhuru reiterated his support for Raila. He also reportedly hinted at being ready to lose his Ksh700 million retirement perk, with the March 16 Constitutional deadline for his exit from politics fast approaching. ""I am retired, but I am not tired. I might be out of the office but I am fully behind Raila. If he tells me we go this way, we will,"" Uhuru stated during a rally on Saturday, February 12.""I supported him in 2022, and I will back him because he is an honest man out to unite Kenya. I am not looking for any seat, but it is my right to back Raila,"" he added, with analysts arguing that his sentiments signified that he was not interested in a handshake or peace pact with Ruto.However, political analyst Javas Bigambo argued that Uhuru suffered a blow rather than Ruto. Uhuru, he argued, was pinned such that he could not come out to defend Jubilee from fracturing.""That is, first of all, a psychological blow by William Ruto to Uhuru Kenyatta. Uhuru is a party leader of a party that it fractured, and he cannot come out with his thorax to depend its political activism,"" Javas Bigambo stated.""In fact it is Raila Odinga who is running to Jubilee Headquarters to salvage Kioni and not Uhuru Kenyatta. It means that the membership of Jubilee Party is questionable,"" he added.Bigambo added elected members could withdraw their subscriptions to Jubilee faction led by Kioni, starving it of cash. Ruto would thus take Jubilee Party and render it inconsequential or reclaim the party and use it to plan for 2027 re-election bid.""Unless Uhuru Kenyatta finances Jubilee from his pocket,"" he argued.

They mostly studious or cluster of flats that share communal spaces such as kitchens and bathrooms.In the report, Knight Frank projected that more than five other companies would launch purpose-built student accommodation by 2024.Among the areas attracting investors building purpose-built student accommodation include Hurlighum, Parklands, Northland city, Juja and areas adjacent to Kenyatta University.According to the report, purpose-built student accommodation offers a unique experience compared to other students hotels in public universities.With the recent investment in affordable housing projects, Knight Frank projected a boom in purpose-built student accommodation."

https://nairobiwire.com/,https://nairobiwire.com/2023/02/what-are-the-challenges-facing-the-institutionalization-of-crypto-assets.html,What are the challenges facing the institutionalization of crypto assets?,Nick Mwangi,https://nairobiwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/crypto.jpg,"In the past two years, the crypto world has developed rapidly. The Bitcoin market started in 2009, and nowadays it’s a flourishing marketplace loaded with cryptocurrency services and products.The world has more than 9,000 Cryptoasset right now as well as the number of users on exchanges is more than forty million.So, if you are planning to trade or mine Bitcoin, then you may visit www.bitcoin-motion.softwareNevertheless, despite these major advances, cryptos have to go a long way before widespread acceptance. All specialists in the area concur that institutionalization is needed to develop confidence, improve access, and ease upscaling.For instance, Coinbase thinks that crypto is going to mature in three phases: Speculative investment, utility and institutionalisation.The reason behind Cryptocurrency institutionalization is important In contrast to many other asset classes in the current economic structure today, the growth of cryptocurrencies was driven by retail trading instead of institutional adoption. Consequently, present platforms as well as products were mostly created with the normal consumer in mind.Consequently, elements such as competent custodians to help with the storage of property, transparent and effective cost analysis equipment, as well as high frequency, very low latency matching engines are almost non-existent in the crypto area. Within the Cryptocurrency area, financial institutions are numerous kinds of stakeholders.They require truthfulness, conformity as well as governance to trade with crypto, without with general clients. The rise in institutional interest will motivate the marketplace to give priority to innovative developments which do not compromise security, conformity, or maybe consumer protection.Crypto businesses could be assisting to hasten mainstream adoption by aiming to meet up with the standards as well as practices started by conventional financial institutions.Which are the challenges faced by the institutionalization of crypto assets?Security ConcernsCrypto companies are key targets for hacktivists as they’re naturally electronic and frequently loaded with worth. Crypto transactions additionally occur within the public web, making the assets and any related services prone to conventional cyberattacks such as phishing or malware.Perhaps even businesses outside of the market are vulnerable to online hackers aiming to take computing power for crypto mining.The assets aren’t the sole items which are in danger. The organizations likewise need safeguards for competitive intelligence data which might be leaked by way of the blockchain. Transaction data isn’t offered publicly in conventional equity markets.In case that was the truth, players as well as competition might use it for many purposes, including industry manipulation.Unestablished Regulatory Systems The cryptoassets are now an essential component of the growing tokenized economic system and are getting considerable interest from financial services providers.The business is having a hard time appealing to conventional brokers, though, because of an absence of clear regulatory guidelines. The trading world demands a dependable end-to-end clearing as well as a settlement method to help with crypto-asset trading. Cryptoassets presently lack the main clearing depository as well as a transfer agent to supply services including asset transfer services as well as set obligations for completely paid securities.In the present decentralized electronic versions, additional government requirements, like the industry as well as transaction filing, and audit trail management, are nearly impossible to meet up with.Tax Implications The crypto industry is very fast expanding but there remains limited guidance regarding tax compliance.The IRS sees virtual currencies in 2014 as electronic representations of worth which operate as exchange media but do not have all of the characteristics making them genuine currencies, like legitimate tender status.Cryptos aren’t currencies, based on the IRS. When cryptocurrencies are viewed as actual assets, then any losses or gains from the purchase of the property are taxable like a capital gain or even loss."

Hatauende wapi kuongeza dawa nguvu hiyo tushajua. My advice “come back to God, work hard and move on,” Jamal wrote.“She is currently in Tanzania. God’s people I need your prayers,” he added.Speaking in an interview with Ankali Ray on Milele FM this week, Jamal was asked to clarify his claims about Amira.“Lakini sasa anaenda Tanzania kuna product gani anaenda kununua Tanzania?” he posed.To which Ankali responded: “Mambo yake ya beauty beauty (her cosmetics business).”But Jamal strongly disagreed, saying Kenya does not import beauty products from Tanzania. He also said he knows Amira inside out having been with her for 15 years.The businessman further claimed that Amira’s friends told him everything she was up to in Tanzania.“[Beauty products] Gani? Wewe ushawai ona gani imetoka Tanzania imekuja Kenya? Tumekaa na yeye miaka 15 kila mtu anajuana kwa vilemba. Siwezi kua naamka asubuhi kama kiongozi naongea kama mwenda wazimu na ako na marafiki wananipatia tu story yake,” Jamal said.When asked if Amira was using witchcraft when they were married, he said: “Ni mabeste yake vile wananiambia.”Jamal also said he believes that Amira used witchcraft on him. He claimed he might have been under a spell when they were together.“Kwa hivyo ata wewe alikupulizia?”Ankali asked. To which Jamal responded: “Uenda ikawa ndo nkapagawa nkakua mjinga hapa hivi.”   A post shared by Milele FM (@milelefm)"

I am a filmmaker and an actress.Did you always want to be an actor?Well, yes, my interest in acting started in high school. Upon joining Form One, I joined the drama club and everything came naturally and I fell in love with this. I was always the main character in my school drama either play or dance.How did you venture into professional acting after high school?After high school, I proceeded to university to pursue a degree in theatre arts and a diploma in film production.For the Classmates TV Show, I went for an audition and it was for a Kalenjin accent. I have always played around with this accent and that day it came in handy. I got the role Chep and the beautiful journey began. Another show I have featured in is In your Shoe (KU TV), and some reality show in (Honey TV) but the two shows I just featured in one episode each.How are you planning to expand your acting career?Well, I am working on my YouTube channel, aiming at posting more content in the future, TikTok as well. I also go for auditions and cross my fingers to land on other challenging roles.What else do you do?Like I said before, I did film production and theatre arts for both my diploma and degree so I also do audio-video editing, I direct and script. I do online jobs as well, last but not least I make DIY home decor and earings with polymer clay.How and why do you juggle these tasks?Editing and transcription I do when not on set. Since shoots are usually continuous for a period of time then you are free for some time before resuming. Why? because I am not yet at a level where I can say acting pays me so well that I don’t need to do anything else. But I am heading there.What do you like about acting? Anything you don’t like about it?What I love about acting is being in character, to me, it’s about living the life of this character than it is acting. From the characters in the Bible, you feel this character, think like this character, live the character, you are the character. You get to feel and experience things that in your normal life you haven’t. It’s beautiful. I don’t think there is anything I don’t like about acting except perhaps the tendency by the audience not to differentiate between the character and the actor, you can meet someone who doesn’t like your character and he or she brings up issues.Many characters are exploiting digital platforms to make money, how are you doing it personally?Like I said earlier, I am currently working on my digital media platforms. Make it more active from there I am hoping to grow and reach that point of earning from my socials.What don’t people know about Chepkoech or rather Neshiro Meegesh?I am this Maasai village girl that they are about to know.Acting does have a psychological and emotional effect on actors, any personal experience?When I did the film Film Wimped, the plot was about GBV. By the time I was done with the film I was emotionally drained, the character Miriam was abused physically, psychologically, mentally and ended up dying. The fact that this happens in real life causes me mental anguish, yaani I think it’s the hardest role I have taken so far.Then for Chep (Classmates) this girl is too blonde for life some few days after shoots I am still stupid (laughs).What main challenge do you think Kenyan actors are facing?Going for auditions for films is very demoralizing, you go for like 15 different auditions and no one calls you back, or if they do you get an extra role, sometimes you feel like you don’t have what it takes ama?Your closing remarks?Art is beautiful, the creative mind is beautiful. If you are good at anything in the creative world, go for it. It will not be a smooth journey but it’s a beautiful journey."

Your success cannot be measured only through the increase of salaries,” he said.He spoke on Tuesday when he met workers representatives at State House, Nairobi.They were led by the Secretary General of the Central Organisation of Trade Unions (COTU) in Kenya Francis Atwoli.Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua, Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi, among other leaders were present.The President said labour unions are integral drivers of policy making that contribute to equality and inclusive socio-economic development.“That is why we should routinely engage and partner to create synergy and ease resolution of labour-related issues.”He pointed out the welfare of workers — particularly those in the Diaspora — and making workplaces safer and more dignified, as some of the areas of cooperation.Further, the President asked the Unions to work with the Government in the Affordable Housing Project that promises decent homes to millions of ordinary Kenyans.“We should also work together to actualise the Universal Health Coverage that will ensure all Kenyans access quality and affordable medical care.”Mr Atwoli said time for politics is over.He said COTU will work together with the Government in pushing its development agenda.“We cannot move forward as a country when we engage in retrogressive politics,” he said.Mr Gachagua said the Government will work with all leaders for unity and development of the country.“Elections should not be an issue to divide the country,” said the Deputy President.Mr Mudavadi noted that politics is over.“It is time to serve Kenyans,” he noted.– PSC"

We have received positive stories from borrowers who have properly utilized their loans to stabilize and expand their business. This is very encouraging,” said CS Chelugui."

If that is done, Kenyans will fear taking part in corruption.“Leaders influence national culture. One of the cultures the president can create is the net worth declaration habit. Let him declare his wealth, and everyone else in government should follow suit,” he said.Wainaina at the same time asked the Head of State to introduce austerity measures use of financial resources.“Running a government is expensive. Why should our ministers drive around in fuel guzzlers? Why can’t we buy 2,000cc vehicles for them? Let us reduce looting in government, cut spending and make corruption very expensive,” said Dr. Wainaina.“Some of the looting happens in procurement. Why should a biro pen bought at Sh10 at the supermarket be sold to the government at Sh500? Why can’t the government officers hold meetings in their respective work locations instead of taking them to other counties?” the clergyman posed."

We are human beings. In fact, I am contemplating leaving Twitter. That whole cyber-bullying thing I will leave to Nyamu (Nominated Senator Karen Nyamu). She knows how to deal with it,” Orwaba said.The lawmaker said Karen Nyamu advised her to soldier on and not let cyberbullies get to her.“I was talking to Senator Nyamu about it and she said no (to her leaving Twitter). She said the moment you get through it and cross to the other side no one can tell you anything. But it is intense and it gets to you. I won’t lie that I don’t care because it really gets to me,” she said.Senator Orwaba maintained that men need education on menstrual health from the women in their families to understand the challenges they go through.“We need to educate people a bit more. I am not saying they are stupid, I am saying it is understandable that they wouldn’t know about periods. I would say to them to try to be understanding. Maybe sit down with your daughters and wives and have a candid conversation,” she said.“There are many men who just disappear for days when their partners say they are on their periods, and return to ask if it is over. They need to ask their lovers, how do exactly you feel and what do you use? They can learn from a first-hand experience and when they speak it will be from an informed position,” Orwoba added. "

It disturbs me, as a woman, on what we indicate out there to our younger generation that looks upon us on how we dress, as leaders, in this House. There is a better way to bring this out,” Senator Mutinda said.Narok Senator Ledama ole Kinaon his part claimed that Senator Orwoba was not on her menstrual cycle. He reasoned that the Senator was trying to demonstrate the ordeal girls and women go through when experiencing their menstrual cycle.“It is quite evident that the distinguished Senator is picketing. She’s not on her menstrual cycle, it is quite clear that what she’s trying to share with the rest of the world is that she’s picketing,” he said.“We see this thing on social media and TikTok, we’re not blind or stupid. If a mature person realizes that they’re going through something which is, culturally, taboo to be discussed, she would’ve gone to the bathroom, covered herself, and even the other distinguished Senators who are from the female gender here would’ve given her something to wear.”But Senator Orwoba insisted it was a natural accident and accused her fellow Senators of period-shaming her.“I think I’m dressed as per the standing orders; I’m covered, I have a suit, I have collars, I’m just short of a tie. I’m disappointed because the point of order that is being raised to try and attack an accident that is natural…I have stained my clothes…I just want to know, while we’re discussing this issue that is not even in the Order Paper, is it because Senators are not women who have periods? Because then maybe I shouldn’t be in this House,” she stated.“This is the period stigma that is making our girls kill themselves, we have a girl who killed herself because of the same issue that I’m going through, and now I understand because it is the women who are trying to make this a crime. Because maybe it’s Valentine’s Day? Because maybe on Valentine’s Day we’re not supposed to have our periods? I’m shocked that someone can stand here and say that the House has been disgraced, because a woman has had her period?”Senate Speaker Amason Kingi nonetheless kicked her out of the session and directed her to change and come back.Speaking to the press after she was ejected, Senator Orwoba noted she has tabled a motion seeking the provision of free sanitary towels in all public schools."

I have no kids at the moment but I am happy,” he said.Maithya also revealed the secret to having a happy relationship.“I always preach this to people, be happy first and hopefully they meet someone who is happy so that when they come together they don’t depend on the other person to be happy. When you come into a relationship with hang-ups it is not going to work,” he explained.Fidel Maithy aalso explained why he doesn’t post his significant other on social media.“I am not too showy and that is how I grew up. Sometimes I even feel uncomfortable showing the little that I do but it is necessary.

While Elkana managed to recover, David Ngare succumbed.The body of the deceased was taken to Embu Level 5 Hospital morgue awaiting postmortem."

Governors can meet whoever is sitting as President,” Raila said.The former Prime Minister however noted he does not recognise Ruto as President.“He is working as president because there is no vacuum, but I do not recognise him.”Raila Odinga at the same time said governors are not required to meet the president for development to take place.“Governors are okay to meet the person sitting in the position of the President even though I don’t recognize the presidency of Ruto. You do not have to go to the President to have developments,” he said."

The loan limit for the Micro Credit will range from Sh250,000 to Sh2.5 million.About 18.8 million Kenyans have subscribed to the Hustler Fund since its launch, borrowing Sh18.5 billion in 30 million transactions. Sh10 billion of the borrowed amount has been repaid while Sh912 million has been deposited in the savings account.""So far, the Hustler Fund has surpassed all projections and existing records in the financial sector —in just under three months,"" said Chelugui.""We have received positive stories from borrowers who have properly utilized their loans to stabilize and expand their business. This is very encouraging.""The fund is accessible through the USSD code *254# and the mobile application platforms of any of the mobile network operators in Kenya and has no processing fee.When a customer borrows, the approved loan is sent directly to their mobile money account, deposits 95% of it in their money wallet, and the remaining 5% in their savings account. The 5% that goes toward the savings plan is split into 30% for short-term savings and 70% for long-term (pension) savings.If the loan is not repaid in 14 days, the customer’s credit rating is affected and the customer is given 15 more days and if the loan is not repaid, the interest rises from 8% to 9.5% per year.After more than 30 days of default, the borrower loses all the credit scores accumulated and the Hustler Fund account is frozen.

He is reported to have lost so much weight that he could not stand up or support himself.BBC reported that efforts to rehydrate the pastor with serums and liquid foods proved futile as he died a few hours after being admitted.His followers said Barajah was used to fasting but not for such long periods of time.Marques Manuel Barajah, the deceased’s brother, claimed his sibling passed away owing to low blood pressure.

EACC surcharged Ringera and ordered him to pay back the sum to HELB.Aggrieved by this decision, Ringera moved to the High Court seeking to quash the decision by EACC arguing that EACC does not have such powers.In her ruling, Justice Maina held that in protecting public property, the constitutional and statutory powers of EACC extend to securing compensation for the loss of public property from culpable public officers.The judge further ruled that EACC was within the law, which gives it powers to institute as well as conduct civil proceedings for purposes of recovery of public property or confiscate proceeds of corruption.

She is the perfect person, it just happens that she lives thousands of miles away,” he told a local news outlet on Monday.“I bought a ring worth Sh50 for my wedding and my wife used the one she had. She told me she didn't mind the fact that I got a cheap ring. What mattered to her was me, her prince charming.”Musyoki met Deborah, a resident of the US state of Michigan, on Facebook and they fell in love although friends and relatives were opposed to the relationship.Despite being married, the love birds do not live together but they do many things together despite the long distance. Musyoki last saw his wife in June 2021.“Our anniversary is on February 4 and both of us will go to a hotel and we will have a meal on video call. Because of time difference, she will go for lunch and I have dinner so that we can be in sync with the time difference,” he said.“We do everything together, we shop together, take walks together, cook together, sometimes I might encounter something interesting and she is the first person I want to share it with. This has made us grow fond of each other every passing day.”Asked about the challenges in their long-distance marriage, Musyoki said, “We experience challenges like any other relationship, sometimes I miss her so much. With distance, you don’t know sometimes what your partner is up to and so you need all the reassurance you can get.”The man observed that when a couple trusts each other and is committed, they can overcome anything, including long distance.“I take care of myself, I am faithful and I know my wife is faithful too. I cannot cheat on her because I know how that would hurt her and break our marriage,” he added.Musyoki had planned to visit his wife in the US before their marriage but he was denied a Visa. He said the Visa application is a long and rigorous process requiring proof of the relationship as well as financial records.“It was hard saying goodbye and not knowing when we’ll see each other next. I hope we can finally be together soon, she is the best thing that ever happened in my life,” he said.“Good communication is key, don’t let a day pass without communication. If you can meet each other’s communication needs, you can feel like your partner actually isn’t thousands of miles away.”

Alishire also operated a distribution company named Ace Distribution Services that purported to provide meals to be served to children at the Community Enhancement Services site.Community Enhancement Services claimed to have served over 800,000 meals between February and October 2021 while Lake Street Kitchen claimed to have served more than 70,000 meals between December 2020 and April 2021.But in reality, the two organizations served a fraction of the meal amounts claimed. The two organizations fraudulently received more than a million dollars in Federal Child Nutrition Program funds from their sponsor entity, Feeding Our Future. Alishire transferred most of this money to himself and others via shell companies used to receive and launder the proceeds of the fraud scheme.Hoodo Properties was one of the shell companies that Alishire controlled and used to launder proceeds from the fraud scheme, court documents show. On or about November 22nd, 2021, Alishire made a wire transfer of $216,300 from Hoodo Properties to Jaafar Jelle & Co. towards the purchase of the Karibu Palms Resort in Diani Beach, Kenya.In total, Alishire fraudulently claimed approximately $2,427,576.17 in Federal Child Nutrition Program funds, of which Feeding Our Future paid out $1,783,786.45 to him and his co-conspirators. Alishire obtained a total of $712,084.00 in fraud proceeds for himself and the entities he controlled.He pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud and one count of money laundering before US District Judge Nancy E. Brasel on Tuesday.As part of his plea agreement, Alishire will forfeit a boat and trailer, a Ford F150 pickup truck, an apartment unit in Nairobi, Kenya, and the Karibu Palms Resort on the Indian Ocean in Kenya. He also agreed to a $712,084.00 forfeiture money judgment.

Burroughs to 44 months in prison and 30 months of supervised release. She was further ordered to pay approximately $957,000 in restitution and to forfeit approximately $350,000 and a Lexus SUV. Musau, who was charged in 2021, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud. Musau participated in a conspiracy involving romance scams and other online frauds designed to deceive victims into sending money to bank accounts controlled by her and her accomplices, according to the US Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts.“Criminals perpetrating romance scams create fictitious profiles on online dating or social media websites, gain the trust of potential victims and then direct those victims to transfer money under false pretenses,” the US Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts noted.To further the conspiracy, Musau used fake passports in the names of numerous aliases to open bank accounts in and around Boston to receive the proceeds of the romance scams.She then made large cash withdrawals from those accounts in tranches of less than $10,000 in order to avoid detection and currency transaction reporting requirements. Musau also received the proceeds of fraudulent state pandemic unemployment assistance benefits in the names of victims. “As part of the scheme, Musau used at least three different aliases to open nearly ten fraudulent bank accounts and receive approximately $1 million in fraud proceeds,” the US Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts added."

The move by county governments to establish their own health coverage comes as the national government continues to make efforts to implement Universal Health Coverage (UHC).Last week, President Ruto reiterated his administration’s commitment to making universal health coverage a reality.Ruto, who blasted the previous administration for failing to deliver the UHC pledge, said the service will be realized when all levels of government work together.”Universal Health Care is a must to deliver. Jubilee tried and didn’t work but we are not to fail at this time. We must get it right,” he said.

Not all [of them], but quite a number. For every 100 girls, 20-30 girls vanish at the airport, picked up by other Kenyans to undertake an illicit activity,” Mutua said last month.“It is not all gloom as we hear. There are many opportunities. One of the things we have been debating on is that we don’t want a lot of Kenyans to go there as domestic workers. We are about to sign a labour agreement with them [Saudi Arabia] so that we get more professionals to be allowed to go over there.” "

Local police said the matter is under investigation although there might not have been foul play.The two are suspected to have died of carbon monoxide poisoning after retiring to their van in the below-freezing temperatures. The family said the two had been missing for seven days.“The deceased, Catherine and Michelle, were last seen alive at 04.00 of Saturday morning doing their daily selling of food in their truck. Apparently, after closing the business, it’s suspected that they decided to take a nap in the truck based on the position they were found in, sleeping side by side,” reads a WhatsApp message in part.“After the autopsy, it’s been discovered that the cause of death is inhaling carbon monoxide in their sleep, leading to lack of oxygen. So, it’s possible that they used charcoal to cook or something that produces carbon monoxide because the truck had carbon monoxide.

The husband would have paid a Kenyan hitman to kill the subject and dispose of her body in Kenya following her arrival in the country,” the High Commission said.Njeri, who was an athlete for 15 years before studying nursing, said she is waiting for the outcome of an investigation into her claims. “I have been living in fear, but I am certain the government will give me protection...I want to go back to continue doing what I love, which is helping people. I have already obtained restraining orders against him,” she told Nation.Ndereba has denied his wife’s claims, saying he only hired the two men to pick her up when she arrived at JKIA from Canada. He said the men duped Njeri on the murder plot to extort her.  He further dismissed as doctored a WhatsApp conference call of him purportedly instructing a man identified as Swaleh on the killing and dumping of Njeri’s body.He said the conversation was edited by Swaleh and is not a true account of their full conversation, including a third person. “I can create that robot and it will respond as a human. We are in 5G technology and artificial intelligence. Anyone’s voice can be manipulated,” he said.“A criminal can’t use another crime to evade the law. He played against me and my family. He robbed my wife, that’s a fact. He tricked my wife, that’s a fact. He raped my wife, that’s a fact. No matter how sweet he pretends to be. He has no escape. We are on his heels.”Njeri said she will not step foot in the house she lived with her estranged husband in Toronto once she travels back.Nation reports that DCI detectives visited JKIA last week to review CCTV footage from the night Njeri landed and left the airport aboard a black Toyota car.Njeri said the hitmen confessed that her husband paid them Sh1.5 million to kill her and dump her body in Karura forest, but she paid them Sh2 million to spare her life.“The instructions were so clear that they knew I had copies of my properties’ documents with me, which they also asked for as instructed. I pleaded with them to spare my life and they agreed on condition that I pay them Sh2 million,” she said.

Autopsy revealed the bullet was lodged in her lungs,” police said.Witnesses and police said Waithira complained of chest pains moments before she collapsed at around 5 pm on Monday.Her companions called an ambulance, which arrived in time but the responders declared her dead at the scene.Gathenya and her colleagues had walked from their workplace in Upper Hill and was headed home when the incident happened.The body was moved from Nairobi Hospital to Kenyatta University mortuary, where a group of pathologists concluded the death was as a result of a shooting.Nairobi Regional Police Commander Adamson Bungei said the bullet head was handed to ballistic experts for analysis.An initial investigation revealed Gathenya was been shot moments before collapsing."

The alluring images of neighbors, friends, cousins, and acquaintances on social media owning cars just months after immigrating, flaunting brand outfits that peers in villages only dream of and drinking champagne while feasting on meals befitting royalty beckon unforgivingly.  Not to forget the mushrooming state of the art homes put up by diasporas in villages for parents and for themselves upon their anticipated eventual return.  Marinate this with high end vehicles bought for kin in villages by this hardworking lot and what you have is an unquenchable desire to do whatever it takes to emigrate.  Parents, overwhelmed by responsibilities of raising and educating kids in an economy that is comatose, are willing to do whatever it takes to facilitate emigration of older kids.  Every category of visa is attempted: visitor, student, green card lottery, etc. The hope is for the barely sustainable cost of living to be eased once a kid or two shall have emigrated.  Cows, trees, land, vehicles, name them, are sold and agents, diasporas, and universities are contacted to facilitate applications.  Businessmen, honorable members, wash-wash dealers are beseeched to provide proof of financial muscle. It is not uncommon for applicants to be swindled of facilitation fees in the process but the spirit to try remains unquenchable.  Then the lucky ones appear for interviews at embassies, others attend invasive and demoralizing medical check-ups. Eventually, a handful are granted visas. For the lucky few, fundraisers are held as more family assets are sold to bridge unmet balances for travel.The journey to the unknown then begins, with the young lads full of both hope and anxiety.  Arrangements shall have been made by extant diasporas or schools to receive new arrivals.  Then the realities start to hit.  First is loneliness in a culture that is individualistic.  The new arrivals are left home by themselves as the hosts hop from one job to another juxtaposed with school.  Second, the new arrivals are at times subjected to servitude as babysitters, cleaners, etc, as they wait for their paperwork to be reconciled to the host country’s requirements for work and school.  Some are defrauded of the little monies they bring; others are subjected to abuse in ways that are not appropriate for print, their innocence, vulnerability, and immaturity coming in handy here.  Yet there is no other recourse at this point, the tears, heartache, and pain are endured with courage.  There is no retreating, properties were sold and families are waiting for goodies. After all, others survived this stage; albeit, with trauma that lasts a lifetime.  This is now home for a long while, welcome to the Wild Wild West.A ray of hope beams when work permits get approved, but then a second dose of reality hits fast when realization that jobs available are not what was hoped.  Instead of white color jobs, what is available is menial work that is backbreaking and demeaning.  Yet the options are limited.  The young lads must accept this reality, what with responsibilities that must be fulfilled.  The immediate consolation is freedom and lessened dependence on their hosts.  The pay, while mostly minimal by the standard of the host country’s living standards, lulls the immigrant into a sense of being well-off, after all, for the majority, monthly pay constitutes more than the entire combined earnings of immediate family members at home.  Some hastily and prematurely find their own residences at this point and a feeling of invincibility kicks in with young minds feeling free and empowered.  Counsel from older folk at this point is treated with disdain and a sense of arrogance and entitlement clouds the mind.  Newly leased apartments are well furnished, secondhand cars and outfits from brand companies are bought.  By now, networks will have been established with other new arrivals and with other country folk who have been in diaspora for long.  Some networks elevate the new arrivals into improving themselves (by going to school, investing…), others introduce innocent souls to drinking, smoking, escort services, and other forms of deviancy.  Some with prior experiences on these deviant behaviors scale them up, replacing menthol cigarettes with cannabis for example.  Some, unable to keep up with pressures of work and school quit school, tragically risking deportation or years of living below the radars of omnipresent immigration agents.A new dose of reality dawns when word gets to kin that their loved one has gotten a job, and a barrage of requests for support start coming in incessantly. Some callers, unknown to the immigrant prior to immigration, must introduce themselves via totems and lineages.  Requests for support ran the gamut, from school fees, medical bills, payments for vets, funeral expenses, Christmas shopping, day to day consumption needs, name them.  Further, monies for investments are remitted to family members who have no capacity to manage it.  Some of the funds are misused while most of it is invested inefficiently, leading to deep conflict between the immigrant and kin later.  Frustrations from kin compel some immigrants to settle for a life of comfort, one of meeting basic needs while limiting remittances back home. The new responsibilities start to stretch the paycheck, and reality on how little the meager pay is leads to frustrations and at times depression.  Still, double shifts are put in at the expense of one’s well-being and at the expense of kids who are for the most part left to raise themselves as parents try to make ends meet.  Years go by and depending on how one engages his/her time, the results manifest later.  Some will have established families under strenuous circumstances; unfortunately, the stress of supporting kin, trying to fulfill dreams, and changed family roles quite often lead to marital strife, and breakups sadly are the order of the day.  The majority end up straddled between the two societies, unsure of where exactly to settle, with dreams that were initially monumental largely dashed.  Some will have climbed the corporate ladder, others will have become successful entrepreneurs, others jail birds, others deported, some homeless, a few will have returned home willingly, and some will have expired.  It is the reality of the Wild, Wild West! Welcome aboard.By Dr Chris Ketter "

Per the Order, there shall not be public gatherings or travel in these areas from dusk to dawn,” the Embassy said in a statement.The embassy further said US government personnel are restricted from traveling in the areas.This comes barely two weeks after the embassy issued a terror alert advising American citizens in the country to exercise vigilance in high-traffic locations frequented by foreigners.The embassy, through a security advisory circulated on February 9th, urged its citizens in Nairobi and other areas within Kenya to review their personal security plans.It noted that the Kenyan capital city remains a key target for terrorists who may be planning imminent attacks in the country.“Terrorist groups could attack with little or no warning, targeting hotels, embassies, restaurants, malls and markets, schools, police stations, places of worship, and other places frequented by foreigners and tourists,” the alert read in part.American nationals and other foreigners were asked to be mindful of their surroundings and keep an eye on local media for updates.In addition, the American embassy said the government of Kenya has heightened its counterterrorism patrols in response to the increased threat of terrorism.

The exchange rate currently stands at Sh125.5 to the dollar.“We have an outstanding balance of $462 million (Sh57.77 billion). A default notice has been issued by the guaranteed lender which is US Exim Bank which has called on the government of Kenya to pay. Now we don’t have, to say the truth, enough headroom to pay, but what is important is to pay,” Kiptoo told the committee on Public Debt and Privatization.Initially, the KQ loan was a 12-year facility provided by Citi Bank and JP Morgan before PEFCO took it over as Exim and Kenya government joined in as guarantors.In December, the government announced it would take over loans amounting to $485 million (Sh59.7 billion) that it had guaranteed the airline.Kiptoo told MPs that the government has been undertaking KQ restructuring dubbed “Project Kifaru.”“To date, Sh16.3 billion has been disbursed under Project Kifaru to turn around the company,” he said.He pointed out that the Cabinet had initially approved Sh30 billion to restructure KQ but the amount was reduced by Sh10 billion.“Every project will suffer, including the KQ. It is a debt they have to pay. We must look at how to restructure KQ and bite the bullet,” he said.“Do we have a choice when it is cold? Can we continue allowing KQ to perennially drain cash on us? We have to restructure it.” In December, President Ruto met officials of Delta Air Lines during his visit to the US, where he launched a bid to sell a controlling stake in Kenya Airways.“I’m willing to sell the whole of Kenya Airways Plc. I’m not in the business of running an airline that just has a Kenyan flag, that’s not my business,” Ruto told Bloomberg on the sidelines of the US-Africa Leaders’ Summit hosted by President Biden in Washington, DC.“Discussions with Delta are at a preliminary stage. The government is looking for partnerships that will make Kenya Airways a profitable entity whatever that means, in whatever configuration, whatever form it takes,” he added.

Her plight brought together Kenyans worldwide who raised money to cover her medical costs.The effort failed to raise enough funds to afford her specialized care in Europe, but the Kenyan government stepped in and transported her to Kenya for care at Kenyatta University Hospital. She died three weeks later, on Monday, February 13, 2022.Statement From Lavi Atkins, A Good Samaritan Joy’s Mother Described As An Angel For Her Selfless Support To Her Daughter.While hospitalized in Albania, Joy Aoko was always under the loving care of her mother Ruth Abong’o and Lavi Atkins. | Photo courtesy of Lavi Atkins
Joy Aoko Achieng died this morning (Monday, Feb.13, 2023)It is with great sorrow that we announce the passing of Joy. That beautiful 22-year-old Kenyan girl was attacked in Albania in August.Joy was a young lady who defied the odds and fought bravely for her life. Her battle for life erased tribal lines and united Kenyans worldwide in a quest to find her the best medical help in Europe. She never gave up. We never gave up.Albanians and ex-pats in Albania joined this quest wholeheartedly. Unfortunately, it was not to be, and Joy and her mum, Ruth Abong’o, traveled to Kenya on 23rd January.Joy continued her fight for life for three more weeks but left us this morning. It was a long hard road, especially for her mother, Ruth. She showed extraordinary courage in the face of adversity, caring for Joy in the hospital in Albania.It does not seem so long ago that I met Joy for the first time in an Albanian hospital. My heart breaks, not just for myself and her family but for everyone who stood with Joy and us, never wavering in their support.It is so sad and so unfair, but life never is. When Joy left Albania, we missed her, but we were hopeful that in this life, we would get to hear her voice, watch her walk, and talk.Kenyans React To Joy’s Death, And Demand Answers“These Things Are Happening To Kenyans All Over, It Used To Be Just Saudi Arabia, But Now We See Albania And So Far No Action Has Been Taken. She Was Brutally Murdered, It Could Happen To Any Of Us Out Here, We Need To Do Something More Than Just Calling In The Government To Talk To Albania,” Samuel, A Kenyan In The US.
Kenyans worldwide have reacted with sadness at the news of Joy’s death. He plight and circumstances of her situation captivated Kenyans’ imagination and many rallied to assist and hoped she’d beat the odds and live to tell who assaulted her.“I’m really sad, I feel as if I lost a little sister. She was so young and beautiful and from what I’ve heard she was a great daughter, full of life and with a kind heart,” Njeri Wa-Waciuri, a California resident said. “We’ll put her family in our prayers.”Our diaspora leaders need to mobilize action so we can pressure the Albanian government to fully investigate this matter, Samuel, who requested we only use his first name said.“These things are happening to Kenyans all over, it used to be just Saudi Arabia, but now we see Albania and so far no action has been taken,” Samuel said. “She was brutally murdered, it could happen to any of us out here, we need to do something more than just calling in the government to talk to Albania.”Incidents of Kenyans getting killed in Saudi Arabia and Middle Eastern countries have dominated the news, but this is the first incident widely known of a Kenyan getting killed in Albania.“I hope Kenyans all over the world will do more and send a message to these governments that we’re human beings who are entitled to the same protection as their citizens,” Samuel said. “We should protest in all the Albanian embassies, until they arrest the person who killed Joy.”Source-https://www.africanavoice.com/Video by Sauti TV Joy Aoko: Kenyan Diaspora who was brutally attacked in Albania Dies"

We are watering down the essence of Parliament,” he said.Speaker Kingi was then forced to kick her out of Senate chambers, but before this, some legislators from both sides of the House began shouting at each other.“According to the dress code for lawmakers, women should wear clothes that are modest. What Honorable Nyamu is wearing is not appropriate,” shouted Senator Edwin Sifuna.However, Speaker Kingi decided to end the debate by giving his ruling on Ms Nyamu’s dress code.“Seantors are required not to enter the chamber lounge or dining room without being properly dressed; male MPs must wear collared long-sleeved shirts, a tie, a pair of socks and shoes.Women, on the other hand, should wear clothes that are decent, formal, and are of business-wear nature.Senator Nyamu, I’m afraid you do not fit the bill and I am going to ask you to leave the chambers, dress properly and come back to the chambers,” he said.By Hilary KimuyuSource-https://nation.africa/kenya Karen Nyamu Ejected From Senate Chambers Over Inappropriate Dressing"

The Ministry of Immigration has been completely overwhelmed and backlogged on files just like this,” Green told CTV News Toronto, adding that Mulwa’s temporary extension, for further consideration of his request to stay on humanitarian and compassionate grounds, is a community win.“And certainly for every story like John, there are unfortunately many others that aren’t successful, so we’re really happy to be able to celebrate this one with the community.”Even though Mulwa says he is “relieved” to be in the country for the next little while, he cannot help but look ahead to what will happen after.“If I don’t get something more permanent in 18 months, I will still be facing the same deportation [order]. I will still be sent back home with people threatening me,” he said. “I’m pleading with the government to still give me a chance – a more permanent chance – for me to be able to safely stay here, and without stress.”Joshua Makori, Mulwa’s immigration lawyer, confirmed to CTV News Toronto that Mulwa’s application for permanent residency has already been filed through the humanitarian and compassionate grounds stream.A spokesperson for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) told CTV News Toronto in a statement that those “who would not normally be eligible to become permanent residents through regular programs” may apply for this stream. Since Mulwa had already exhausted other avenues in the years that he has lived in Canada, he is eligible to apply for this kind of permanent stay.“Before [Mulwa] was given the extension of 18 months, we had already submitted an application for him. This is also one of the routes that somebody can become a permanent resident,” Makori said.“We did get a communication from immigration in connection to his humanitarian and compassionate application. It looks like somebody’s keeping an eye on it,” Makori added, saying he had received notice from the agency on Thursday.Now, Makori says all there is left to do is “trust” the process.“One of the reasons why he was given 18 months was basically to create room so that immigration would be able to complete his process,” Makori said.The IRCC said it could not comment on Mulwa’s case due to privacy legislation.“Every individual facing removal is entitled to due process, but once all avenues to appeal are exhausted, they are removed from Canada in accordance with Canadian law,” the spokesperson for the IRCC said.By Alex ArsenychSource-https://www.iheartradio.ca/ Kenyan Diaspora John Mulwa dodge imminent deportation from Canada"

No one wants to remain static, we all want to progress and prosper. Everyone wants to achieve something and no one wants to be like stagnant water which has some stench.
So, how do you maximize your time?Time is short indeed very short.How do you progress using time?Work with others – Those who cannot gel with their teams are like lonely buffaloes. In the wild when preying, the team achieves more by working together. Everyone is important because they have something is contribute.Respect the values ascribed – In the case of Optiven, values are a part of our culture. These are honesty, professionalism, customer obsession and innovation.Observe the bosses – that which matters and drive results. In our case the customer, target and values. Once you observe these, your work becomes easy.Keep your smile on – Don’t be the person that shares bad news in the morning. Spread positive energy to encourage others to be ready to work. If you can handle it, don’t share it, handle it instead. Allow people to keep their smiles by encouraging them to be the best they can be.Prosper by working hard – Nothing comes easy. Invest in yourself as you also invest in those you value. Once you do your best, it will be a joyous success.Keep your eyes on what you want in life – What do you want in life? What is your purpose? Write it down and plan how you will achieve it.Build your self-confidence – Many times we miss it because we have zero confidence. Whatever you do, be confident about it. Whatever gives you confidence, embrace it fully be it dressing, media, books, motivation, mentors, and self speak – build your confidence.To achieve remain very focused – When you are focused you can’t be waylaid easily. By focusing your vision on something, you are likely to get it as an achievement. Target instead of being all over. You cannot be everything, keep the focus.To achieve be strategic – Understand the future and vision of where you want to be. See beyond the next 5 or 10 years. Be organized, orderly and manage yourself. Account for your time by seeing what you have achieved and what you want to achieve, thus the need for a plan.Remember to read, read within your area of specialty.

In an interview on Voice of America, Ruto said that Miguna has not committed any offense to be blocked from coming back to his homeland.
